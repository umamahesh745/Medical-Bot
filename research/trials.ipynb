As in previous years, all the chapters of\\nHIV 2015/2016 have been thoroughly revised. \\nAgain, special emphasis was put on actuality. This is underlined by the fact that in\\nthe antiretroviral therapy chapter alone, more than 100 are dated in the years 2013\\nand 2014. \\nPrevious issues of the progenitor “HIV Medicine” were available in several langua-\\nges, such as Spanish, Romanian, Portuguese, Vietnamese and Persian. We are very\\nproud that a Russian issue could be published in 2015. \\nUnder certain conditions, the editors and the authors of this book may agree to\\nremove the copyright on HIV 2015/2016 for all languages except English and\\nGerman. You could therefore translate the content of this book into any language\\nand publish it under your own name, without paying a license fee.\\nHIV 2015/2016 is also freely available on the Internet (www.hivbook.com), because\\nwe firmly believe that this is the way medical textbooks should be handled in the\\n21st century.

Introduction\\nJÜRGEN KURT ROCKSTROH\\nAcquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) was first described as a not needed\\nclinical entity in 1981. Initial reports were based on an unusual increase in the inci-\\ndence of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), diseases that were\\nconsidered at that time to occur rarely. While both diseases are occasionally observed\\nin different populations (e.g., KS in older men from the Mediterranean region or PCP\\nin patients with leukemia after intensive chemotherapy), the occurrence of these\\n diseases as indicators for severe immunodeficiency had not been observed before in\\notherwise healthy young individuals. Because the initially affected population were\\nmen who had sex with men (MSM) the disease as well as those with the disease were\\nhighly stigmatized. Though at first lifestyle and behavioral factors were  hypo thesized\\nto be causally related, finally in 1983 the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was\\nidentified as the true cause of AIDS. \\nIn 1987 the first antiretroviral agent, AZT (zidovudine, Retrovir\\n®) was licensed for\\nthe treatment of HIV. Despite the failure of this therapeutic concept as monother-\\napy in achieving long-term suppression of HIV replication, symptoms and clinical\\nmanifestations of HIV infection were temporarily relieved with AZT (at 1500 mg/day)\\nand the occurrence of AIDS was slightly delayed. What happened next is unprece-\\ndented in medicine to date – within a few years of its discovery, an inevitably deadly\\ndisease turned into a disease with durable and effective treatment options. The rapid\\nintroduction of additional antiretroviral drug classes and the concept of highly active\\nantiretroviral therapy (HAART, an acronym that will be replaced in this book by ART)\\nenabled a durable suppression of viral replication thereby preventing disease pro-\\ngression – as long as the antiretroviral drugs were  tolerated and taken regularly. Long-\\nterm toxicities and the emergence of resistance led to a search for and identification\\nof further promising drugs with other therapeutic mechanisms of action or better\\nresistance profiles. In parallel, administration modalities and tolerability of anti-\\nretroviral drug regimens improved significantly. In 2015 several HIV therapies are\\navailable that only require an intake of 1–2 tablets a day mostly resulting from the\\nintroduction of fixed-dose combinations.\\nAll these advances should not be confused with the fact that lifelong medical therapy\\nwill probably lead to substantial problems, especially in terms of adherence to therapy\\nand possible long-term toxicities. With 20 years of experience so far, the latter aspect\\nhas thus far only been captured in part. Infection with HIV should still be avoided\\nat all costs. Apart from further improvement of ART and development of new\\n therapeutic concepts such as eradication, a main focus of our endeavors must be the\\nprevention of HIV in order to contain the further spread of disease. \\nThe HIV epidemic\\nIn 1981 the first three clinical descriptions of AIDS were published in the Morbidity\\nand Mortality Weekly Report and later the New England Journal of Medicine. These\\nreports described an epidemic of community-acquired Pneumocystis pneumonia, in\\nmost cases combined with oral thrush in previously healthy homosexual men, as\\nwell as chronic ulcerating perianal herpes infections (Gottlieb 1981a, Gottlieb 1981b,\\nMasur 1981, Siegal 1981). \\nA little later, in June 1982, a notice from the Centers for Disease Control and\\nPrevention (CDC) on three PCP cases among hemophiliacs was issued (CDC 1982a).\\nIn the same year a case of cryptosporidiosis in a hemophiliac patient from\\n2'),\n",

The occurrence of AIDS among  hemophiliacs\\ntriggered a discussion of whether a viral infection could cause AIDS (Marx 1982). In\\nparticular, the similarity of populations at risk for AIDS and hepatitis B led to the\\nhypothesis of a viral agent causing AIDS. \\nStudies on AIDS patients comprising different populations at risk quickly revealed\\ncommon characteristics: compared to healthy controls, all AIDS cases had  diminished\\ncounts of CD4-positive T lymphocytes. Conversely, a relative and absolute increase\\nin CD8-positive T lymphocytes and a reduced mitogen-induced proliferative  capacity\\nof lymphocytes was observed (Gottlieb 1981, Masur 1981, Siegal 1981, Mildvan 1982,\\nStahl 1982). It became quickly clear, however, that the manifestation of AIDS was\\nnot a prerequisite for developing an immune deficiency. A defect of cellular immu-\\nnity, associated with a generalized lymphadenopathy, had already been described\\nvery early in otherwise asymptomatic men who had sex with men (Kornfeld 1982,\\nStahl 1982). In January 1983 two cases of hemophiliacs with a lymphadenopathy\\nsyndrome were reported, both with significant dysfunction of cellular immunity\\n(Ragni 1983). This led to the assumption that the lymphadenopathy syndrome and\\nthe observed cellular immune defects may have been precursors to AIDS and that a\\ntransmission of the AIDS causative agent via blood products was probable.\\nSubsequently numerous studies on altered states of cellular immunity among hemo-\\nphiliac patients were published. The main finding was a reduced CD4/CD8 ratio, the\\nresult of a relative and/or absolute decrease of CD4 lymphocyte counts together with\\nelevated CD8 T cell counts. Only those patients who had been treated with small\\namounts of blood-clotting factors or where blood-clotting factors had been derived\\nfrom small donor pools showed normal lymphocyte subpopulations (Luban 1983,\\nRasi 1984). \\nThe altered immunological findings among hemophiliacs were discussed heatedly.\\nIn part they were attributed to a chronic antigen exposure due to the blood-clotting\\nfactor substitution. Other groups considered this hypothesis unlikely, given the fact\\nthat, prior to the advent of AIDS, no enhanced risk for infections was observed among\\nhemophiliacs compared to other populations (except for viral infections, in partic-\\nular hepatitis B and non-A-non-B-hepatitis via receipt of blood products). Overall,\\nat that time no indication was seen to call into question the concept of blood-clot-\\nting substitution therapy among hemophiliacs (Anonymous 1983, Goldsmith 1983).\\nAs an alternative explanation of AIDS, particularly among the transmission group\\nof men who have sex with men, coinfection with human cytomegalovirus, use of\\ninjection drugs, inhalation of amyl nitrate (poppers) and exposure to foreign pro-\\nteins (spermatozoa) were discussed (Essex 1997). \\nIn 1983 different working groups raised the hypothesis that a variant of the T-lym-\\nphotropic retrovirus (HTLV-I), which had been discovered in 1980 by Gallo and\\n colleagues, could be the causative agent of AIDS (Essex 1983, Gallo 1983). Several\\narguments were in favor of this hypothesis. At that time HTLV-I was the only known\\nvirus with the potential to infect human CD4-positive T lymphocytes (Poiesz 1980).\\nIn addition, HTLV-I shared the same transmission routes with the potential AIDS\\nagent, i.e., sexual contacts, blood-to-blood and perinatal transmission (Essex 1982). \\nFirst experiments to isolate virus related to HTLV-I or -II were only partially suc-\\ncessful. Though cross-reactive antibodies with HTLV-related genome sequences were\\nfound in a small subset of AIDS patients, the overall assay reactivity was weak and\\nsuggested a coinfection with HTLV. The observations led to the assumption of a\\ngenetically more distant virus, one with weaker assay reactivity, as a putative  etiologic\\nagent. Indeed only a short time later, HTLV-III, later renamed Human Immuno -\\ndeficiency Virus type I (HIV-1), was discovered as the causative agent of AIDS (Barré-\\nIntroduction    3'),\n",

In 2008 the French research group of Luc Montagnier\\nand Francoise Barré-Sinoussi received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their discov-\\nery of HIV-1.\\nTransmission routes\\nThe main transmission routes of HIV are\\n1. unsafe sex with an HIV-infected partner \\n2. sharing injection paraphernalia with an HIV-infected partner \\n3. vertical transmission of HIV from the HIV+ mother to the newborn (before or at\\nbirth; or later, due to breastfeeding)\\nAll other transmission routes, for the most part case reports, are notably rare. Among\\nthese are transmissions due to transfusion of blood or blood products in countries\\nwhere blood donations are not routinely screened for HIV. \\nExtremely rare are transmissions due to contact with HIV+ blood through open\\nwounds or mucosa, or transmission of HIV after a bite (Bartholomew 2008). Three\\ncases were reported where mothers infected their newborns probably via pre-chewed\\nfood (Gaur 2008). These transmission routes however are of a casuistic nature. Large\\ncase registries, in particular from the CDC, which have investigated other transmis-\\nsion routes of HIV , clearly show that daily contacts of everyday life, such as the shared\\nuse of toilets or drinking from the same glass, cannot transmit HIV. Case registries\\nin the health care setting, which analyze contact via saliva, urine, or infectious blood\\nwith intact skin, did not find a single transmission of HIV (Henderson 1990). \\nPotentially favorable factors and risks \\nSex\\nThe most important transmission route for HIV is sexual contact. The prerequisite\\nfor sexual transmission is direct exchange of infectious body secretions / fluids. The\\nhighest viral concentrations are found in blood and seminal fluid. A study investi-\\ngating heterosexual transmission of HIV in female partners of HIV+ hemophiliacs\\nin Bonn found an HIV seroconversion rate of 10% (Rockstroh 1995). The risk for\\nsexual transmission was significantly higher if the HIV+ partner suffered from\\nadvanced immunodeficiency or an advanced clinical stage of HIV infection. It is\\nimportant to note that a precise calculation of transmission risk of one individual\\nexposure is not possible. Various environmental factors have an influence on the\\nactual transmission risk, such as specific sexual practices, concurrent sexually trans-\\nmitted diseases, skin lesions, circumcision and mucosal trauma, that are difficult to\\ntake into account. The average transmission risks according to different sexual prac-\\ntices are shown in Table 1.\\nThe correlation of transmission risk with the level of HIV viremia has important\\n epidemiological implications. In environments where body fluids like blood and\\nseminal fluid are exchanged with many persons over days or weeks, the risk of\\nmeeting people who have been recently infected, and thus who are highly  infectious,\\nis high. Likewise, the probability of infecting someone else between the  transmission\\nevent and the detection of HIV antibodies is high. The later stage of disease is also\\na highly infectious period, as HIV infection progresses and higher viral loads are\\nagain observed as one gets closer to falling below 200 CD4 T cells or AIDS. Sexually\\ntransmitted diseases and infections disrupt physiological skin and mucosal barriers\\nand enhance the risk for HIV transmission. This is particularly true for endemic areas\\nwith a high prevalence of other sexually transmitted diseases. Primarily genital herpes\\nlesions have been identified as a potential co-factor facilitating HIV transmission in\\nendemic areas (Mahiane 2009). \\n4 The Basics'),\n",

The Swiss Commission for AIDS (“Eid -\\ngenössische Kommission für AIDS-Fragen”, EKAF) proposed to classify HIV+ persons\\nwho are on ART with a plasma HIV RNA below the level of detection for at least \\n6 months, if they are adherent to therapy, regularly come to medical examinations,\\nand if they do not have any signs of other sexually transmitted diseases, as persons\\nwho most likely do not transmit HIV via sexual contact and therefore may have\\nunprotected sex if they want (Vernazza 2008). The intention of the EKAF\\n recommendation is to manage fears of HIV transmission and to enable a normal sex\\nlife, as far as possible, between persons with and without HIV. The EKAF recom-\\nmendation is not agreed to by all HIV experts. A case report from Frankfurt raised\\nquestions (Stürmer 2008), where HIV transmission occurred though HIV viral load\\nwas not detectable and the HIV+ partner was on successful ART (see chapter 6.12 on\\nPrevention). It is important to highlight though that large international studies in\\ndiscordant couples with early ART initiation clearly demonstrate a dramatically\\nreduced risk of HIV transmission to the seronegative partner in the setting of\\n suppressed HIV viremia on HIV therapy (Cohen 2011). Ever since these results\\nbecame available, immediate treatment of an HIV+ individual with a seronegative\\npartner was possible according to most HIV treatment guidelines, with the\\n accompanying liberty of condom-free sex. \\nSharing injection paraphernalia\\nSharing injection paraphernalia is the most important HIV transmission route for\\npersons who use drugs intravenously. Due to the usually quite large amount of blood\\nthat is exchanged when sharing needles, the transmission risk is high. The aspira-\\ntion of blood to control the correct intravenous position of the needle constitutes\\nthe reservoir for transmission. With the introduction of needle exchange programs,\\nthe installation of needle vendors, methadone substitution and multiple other pre-\\nventive measures and social programs, HIV transmission rates have significantly\\ndecreased within intravenous drug users in Western Europe.

The most important risk factor is viral load at the time of  delivery.\\nSince 1995 the mother-to-child transmission rate of HIV-1-infected mothers has been\\nreduced to 1–2%. These low transmission rates were reached through the\\n combination of antiretroviral therapy / prophylaxis for the pregnant woman,  elective\\ncesarian section prior to the start of labor (no longer necessary if the maternal HIV\\nviral load is successfully controlled on ART and HIV RNA is persistently undetectable),\\nantiretroviral post-exposition prophylaxis for the newborn and substitution for\\nbreast feeding. For details refer to the “HIV and Pregnancy” chapter as well as to the\\nEuropean AIDS Clinical Society (EACS) guidelines for the clinical management and\\ntreatment of HIV-infected adults (website http://www.europeanaidsclinicalsociety.org/).\\nBlood\\nThe transmission of HIV via blood and blood products has been largely reduced on\\na global scale, though the risk is not completely eliminated. In Germany blood and\\nblood products are considered safe. Since 1985 all blood donations are tested for\\nHIV-1 via antibody tests, and since 1989 also against HIV-2. For a few years now\\nblood donations are additionally tested via PCR to identify donors who may be in\\nthe window of seroconversion and where the HIV ELISA is still negative. Persons\\nwith so-called risk behavior, i.e., active injection drug users, sexually active men and\\nwomen as well as immigrants from high-prevalence countries are excluded from\\nblood donations. \\nOccupationally-acquired HIV infection\\nThe overall risk for HIV infection after a needlestick injury is estimated to be around\\n0.3%. The risk for HIV transmission is significantly higher if the injury occurred\\nusing a hollow needle – e.g., during blood withdrawal – than with a surgeon’s needle.\\nFor details on post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) please refer to the respective chapter\\nin this book. On the other hand, the risk of infecting a patient with HIV when the\\nmedical personnel is HIV+ is extremely low. In 1993 19,036 patients of 57 HIV+\\nphysicians, dentists or medical students were screened for HIV infection (CDC\\n1993a). While 92 patients tested HIV-positive, none of the transmissions was related\\nto the health practitioner. \\nNon-suitable transmission routes\\nIn general, HIV-transmission due to day-to-day contact between family members is\\nunlikely. It is important to avoid blood-to-blood contacts. Thus, razor blades or tooth\\nbrushes should not be commonly shared. In cases of cannula or needle usage, these\\nshould be safely deposited in appropriate sharps-containers and not be placed back\\ninto the plastic cover. \\nInsects\\nAll studies that have investigated the possible transmission of HIV via insects have\\ncome to the same conclusion, that it is not possible. This holds true as well for studies\\nperformed in Africa with a high AIDS prevalence and large insect populations (Castro\\n1988).\\n6 The Basics'),\n",

HIV Testing\\nCHRISTIAN NOAH\\nEarly diagnosis of HIV infection is important: it allows the patient access to  anti -\\nretroviral therapy and it is crucial in order to avoid further transmission. Despite\\nextensive testing possibilities and recommendations, HIV infection continues to be\\ndiagnosed at late stages. According to the 2014 report from the European Centre for\\nDisease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 47% and 27% of HIV+ patients presented\\nwith a CD4 T cell count below 350/µl and 200/µl at the time of initial diagnosis. In\\nGermany, the number of patients unaware of their positive HIV status is estimated\\nat 14,000 (RKI 2014).\\nThere are several indications and reasons for HIV testing. Every pregnant woman\\nshould be offered an HIV test to prevent mother-to-child transmission. HIV testing\\nalso plays an important security role in blood and organ donation. HIV testing is\\nalso indicated in case of symptoms compatible with an acute antiretroviral syndrome,\\nin case of indicator diseases (oral thrush, OHL, etc) or an AIDS-defining illness, as\\nwell as after occupational or non-occupational exposure to HIV. \\nThe basics of HIV diagnostics \\nThe laboratory diagnosis of HIV infection is primarily based on a serologic  screening\\ntest. A reactive result has to be confirmed by a confirmatory test. Due to its  relatively\\nhigh sensitivity, the 4th generation test (“Combo test”) that simultaneously detects\\nboth HIV-specific antibodies and p24 antigen should be used (Breast 2000, Weber\\n2002, Sickinger, 2004, Skidmore 2009, Bentsen 2011). Any approved screening test\\ndetects all known HIV types (HIV-1 and -2), HIV groups and HIV subtypes.\\nThere are numerous commercial systems available for screening. However, the basic\\ntechnological principle is the same for all and is based on antigen-antibody binding.\\nThe prototype assay is the ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay). Its central\\nelement is a plastic plate with 96 wells (microtiter plate). The surface of each cavity\\nis coupled with HIV antigens and HIV antibodies. When a patient’s serum or plasma\\ncontaining HIV antibodies is placed into one cavity, antibodies bind to the coupled\\nantigen. An enzyme-labelled second antibody is then added, which recognizes and\\nbinds to human antibodies. Finally a substrate is added that is converted by the\\nenzyme at the second antibody. The result is a color change, measured photometri-\\ncally. The optical density correlates with the HIV antibody concentration in the sample\\nof the patient – the higher the intensity, the more antibodies present in the sample.\\nBased on this prototype several advances have improved the efficiency and effec-\\ntiveness of the screening test (Perry 2008). Modern test systems are highly automated\\nto achieve a very high degree of standardization and generate a result in less than\\nan hour. In these systems, the solid phase consists of microparticles coupled with\\nthe virus antigens and antibodies. Accordingly, the method is referred to as a\\n“microparticle enzyme immunoassay” (MEIA). \\nThe measured value is usually an index without dimensions, calculated from the\\nratio of the measured value of the patient sample and the negative control\\n(Sample/Control, S/Co). Values below 1 are considered negative, values above 1 as\\nreactive. It should always be called “reactive” and not a “positive” result to docu-\\nment that this result needs to be confirmed by a second test.\\nWith the screening test, sensitivity has the highest priority (this way, no infection\\nshould be missed), while a high specificity is preferred for the confirmatory test.\\nScreening tests approved in Germany require a specificity of 99.5%. That means that\\n15'),\n",

False-reac-\\ntive results are caused for example by stimulation of the immune system (e.g., viral\\ninfections, pregnancy, vaccinations, autoimmune diseases). Thus, in certain patient\\ngroups (e.g., pregnant women, dialysis patients) an increased proportion of false reac-\\ntive test results can occur. \\nTo confirm a reactive screening test a Western Blot (immunoblot) analysis is  typically\\ncarried out. Viral proteins (antigens) are separated by their molecular weight via\\n electrophoresis and transferred to a membrane, which is then used as a test strip. An\\nadvance in terms of standardization is the so-called line blot produced by spraying\\nrecombinant HIV antigens directly onto a test membrane. The test strip is incubated\\nwith the serum or plasma. If HIV-specific antibodies are present, they bind to the\\nantigen. Analogous to the ELISA the resulting antigen-antibody complex will become\\nvisible on the test strip using an enzyme-labeled second antibody and a correspon-\\nding substrate. According to the antibody specificities a corresponding band\\n spectrum occurs on the test strip.\\nIdeally, the laboratory will use a Western Blot, which also can detect and differenti-\\nate antibodies against HIV-2. In some assays, a synthetic peptide is used for HIV-2\\nscreening. In case of a reactive HIV-2 band, this result must be confirmed by an HIV-2-\\nspecific Western Blot. Generally, Western Blot analysis leads to definite discrimina-\\ntion between an HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection. However, due to the close relationship\\ncross reactivity leading to antibody reactions against both virus types can occur. In\\nthose cases, type-specific PCR assays may help. The final laboratory report should\\nindicate if a patient is infected with HIV-1 or HIV-2 since the virus type has\\n implications with regard to the antiretroviral treatment. The various HIV proteins\\nare assigned to three functional groups (“p” – protein, “gp” – glycoprotein. The\\nnumbers refer to the molecular weight):\\nTable 1: HIV antigens and functions\\nAntigens Function\\nHIV-1 HIV-2\\nEnvelope proteins (env) gp160 gp140 Precursor of envelope proteins\\ngp120 gp125 Outer envelope protein\\ngp41 gp36 Transmembrane protein\\nPolymerase proteins (pol) p66 p68 Reverse Transcriptase, RNaseH\\np51 p53 Reverse Transcriptase\\np32 p34 Endonuclease, integrase\\nCore proteins (gag) p55 p56 Precursor of core proteins\\np24 p26 Inner core protein\\np17 p16 Outer core protein\\nThe formation of antibodies after infection follows a specific kinetic: while p24 and\\ngp120 antibodies are detectable early, the p31 band usually occurs later in the course\\nof infection (Fiebig 2003). With regard to the antibody specifics, the criteria for a\\npositive result are not uniformly defined. In general, a Western Blot is considered\\npositive when at least two or three bands are visible. For interpretation of a Western\\nBlot the criteria specified by the manufacturer in the context of CE-marking are\\ncrucial. Furthermore, general guidelines exist. According to the German guidelines,\\nbased on the DIN 58969 Part 41 (“serodiagnosis of infectious diseases –\\nimmunoblot”), a test result is considered positive when antibodies to an env protein\\nand also to a gag protein and/or a pol protein are detected.

For example, a Western Blot with a gp120 and p24 band would be inter-\\npreted borderline according to the WHO and positive according to the German\\n criteria. However, a weak band spectrum, especially if “early” antibodies were\\ndetected, may indicate an early phase of an HIV infection and further tests such as\\nPCR should be carried out (see below). \\nCompared to a 4th generation screening test the p24 antigen is not included in the\\nconfirmatory test. In the case of “reactive screening test – negative confirmatory\\ntest”, acute HIV infection cannot be excluded when HIV-specific antibodies are not\\nyet formed although the p24 antigen is present. Such a result should be checked\\nafter 2-3 weeks. If a patient is concerned regarding an acute infection (acute retro-\\nviral syndrome, recent exchange of bodily fluids with an HIV+ person) the imple-\\nmentation of an HIV PCR is useful. The PCR is also recommended in case of a highly\\npositive screening and negative confirmatory test result. It is recommended to consult\\nthe laboratory to discuss the adequate procedure.\\nTo exclude sample confusion each first positive test result should be confirmed by\\nexamination of a second sample. If a patient is suspected to have an HIV infection,\\nthe result of viral load measurement can be used for confirmation (see chapter 6.11\\non HIV monitoring). In this case, a second serological test is not necessary. \\nHIV PCR\\nIn addition to the serological test systems, molecular methods for detection of HIV\\nRNA (nucleic acid amplifications tests, NAT) are available. PCR is the NAT most\\n frequently used for HIV RNA detection. Other techniques (b-DNA, NASBA) are less\\ncommon. The quantitative detection of HIV RNA (a viral load determination) is one\\nof the essential components of the monitoring of HIV infection (Wittek 2007,\\nThompson 2010). To increase the safety of blood products the HIV PCR is obliga-\\ntory in the context of blood donation. Other indications for the use of the PCR are\\nthe exclusion of an HIV infection of newborns of HIV+ mothers (see below), the\\n clarification of equivocal serological constellations or a suspected acute infection.\\nAccording to new recommendations, PCR analysis may be used for confirmation of\\na reactive screening test result instead of a Western Blot. For this purpose, a PCR test\\nis considered positive in case of a viral load above 1000 copies/ml. If the viral load\\namounts to less than 1000 copies/ml or the PCR is negative subsequent Western Blot\\nanalysis is obligatory (DVV/GfV 2015). However, the HIV PCR is not recommended\\nas a screening test. Since false negative results are possible it cannot replace the\\n serological screening test. \\nPossible reasons for false negative results are as follows:\\n1. Commercially available HIV PCR tests usually do not cover HIV-2 (rare in Europe).\\nThus, an additional HIV-2 PCR must be carried out. \\n2. HIV is characterized by a high degree of genetic diversity. In case of infection with\\na new or previously unknown variant sensitivity of the PCR may decrease due to\\nmutations affecting the primer or probe binding sites. Through a so-called “dual\\ntarget” PCR the risk of false negative test results due to sequence variability may\\nbe reduced (Chudy 2012; see also chapter 6.11 on Monitoring). The “dual target”\\nPCR is obligatory for screening blood donations.\\n3. A small number of HIV+ patients can suppress viral replication in the absence of\\nART (“elite controllers”, prevalence less than 1%). Thus, despite serologically\\nproven HIV infection a PCR test may be negative in those patients. \\n4. The aim of the antiretroviral treatment is the reduction of the viral load below\\nthe detection limit. As a consequence, the use of a PCR as a HIV screening test in\\na successfully treated patient would lead to a false-negative testing result. \\nHIV Testing    17'),\n",

These tests exhibit a high\\nsensitivity and specificity in studies (Huppert 2010). However, apparently there are\\nlimitations regarding diagnosis of primary HIV infection: almost all currently avail-\\nable rapid tests only detect HIV antibodies but not p24 antigen, corresponding to\\nthe (outdated) 3\\nrd generation HIV test. Since 2009 a certified 4th generation rapid test\\n(Determine HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo, Inverness Medical) is available which not only\\ndetects but can also differentiate HIV antibodies and p24 antigen. Although the supe-\\nriority of this rapid test compared to the 3\\nrd generation rapid test was illustrated\\n(Chetty 2012), some studies indicate a lack of sensitivity in the context of acute HIV\\ninfections (Kilembe 2012, Brauer 2013). In a comparative study the test exhibited\\ndeficiencies regarding the recognition of primary HIV infections. About one third of\\nthe samples of patients with acute HIV infection tested falsely negative. Reactivity\\nwas delayed by one week compared to a reference test (Mohrmann 2009). Rapid tests\\nshould be used only for initial orientation. The results of the testing should be con-\\nfirmed at the earliest opportunity in a routine laboratory with a standard HIV test.\\nRapid tests are particularly suitable for use in emergency situations where the test\\nresult has immediate consequences. These include emergency operations and needle-\\nstick injuries. Also in pregnant women with unknown HIV status at delivery a rapid\\ntest can be useful. However, the cooperating laboratory should be contacted to indi-\\ncate the need for a rapid HIV result. When necessary, the result of a conventional\\nHIV test can be available within one hour upon receipt of the sample. Rapid tests\\nare also useful in countries with poor medical infrastructure (UNAIDS/WHO 2009)\\nand in the context of low-threshold testing for individuals who would otherwise not\\nbe tested. \\nThe diagnostic window\\nThe “diagnostic gap” or “window” indicates the time period between transmission\\nof a pathogen and the onset of biochemical measurable infection markers such as\\nantibodies, antigen or nucleic acids (Busch 1997).

HIV-specific antibodies can be detected\\nafter four weeks in 60–65%, after six weeks in 80%, after eight weeks in 90% and\\nafter twelve weeks in 95% of cases.

The earliest lab marker is HIV RNA that is detectable\\napproximately seven days before the p24 antigen (Fiebig 2003). In many cases HIV\\nRNA can be detected by the second week after transmission. However, a negative\\nresult at this time point cannot exclude an infection.\\nA negative result in the HIV screening test precludes the existence of HIV antibod-\\nies and p24 antigen at the time of testing. A patient is considered HIV negative. The\\nsecurity of this result, however, depends particularly on the time interval from the\\npossible transmission event. This has important consequences: \\n1. HIV testing immediately after a possible transmission is not meaningful. As no\\nHIV antibodies are yet formed, an HIV test should be carried out at the earliest in\\nthe 3rd week after exposure. Exception: If it needs to be documented for legal\\nreasons (e.g., needlestick injury) that at the time of transmission no existing HIV\\ninfection was present.\\n2. According to new testing guidelines (Gökengin 2014, DVV/GfV 2015) an HIV\\ninfection cannot be ruled out until 6 weeks after possible transmission with\\n sufficient certainty when a 4\\nth generation screening test was used. In case of a 3 rd\\ngeneration assay or a rapid screening test the diagnostic window amounts to \\n12 weeks. Even when using 4 th generation tests in some circumstances a follow-\\nup at 12 weeks after exposure is recommended, e.g., the simultaneous infection\\nwith another sexually transmitted pathogen or an impaired ability to develop anti-\\nbodies. A further test beyond the diagnostic window is appropriate only in excep-\\ntional cases, for example, if there is suspicion of acute retroviral syndrome or if\\npost-exposure prophylaxis was given. \\n3.

The antibodies are transplacentally transferred from the 32\\nnd week\\nof gestation although they do not have any protective effect. A positive HIV test\\nresult in the newborn indicates previous HIV exposure. However, a serological HIV\\ntest for the detection or exclusion of vertical transmission of HIV is not sufficient as\\na positive result will be expected in any case (Read 2007). \\nAt least two negative PCR results are required to exclude HIV transmission. The first\\nHIV PCR should be performed after the first month of life (sensitivity 96%, speci-\\nficity 99%), then again because of the nearly 100% sensitivity and specificity after\\nthe third month. Vertical transmission can be ruled out, however, only if there was\\nno renewed risk of transmission in the meantime through breastfeeding. \\nEven with negative PCR results, the disappearance of maternal antibodies should be\\ndocumented at least once.

Because of possible medical,\\nsocial and legal consequences, an informed consent of the patient is required before\\nperforming an HIV test. Testing against the wishes of the patient is an invasion of\\nprivacy, potentially corresponding with legal consequences for the doctor. A written\\nconsent is not required, but the consent should be documented. In children or\\ninfants, the patient’s parents or legal guardians must agree. With the aim to increase\\nthe readiness for testing and to enable early access to adequate antiretroviral therapy\\nthe CDC recommendations for HIV testing have been revised. These include a so-\\ncalled “opt-out” screening concept: The patient is informed about the HIV test, but\\nit will be performed provided the patient does not explicitly reject testing (Branson\\n2006).\\n\\x81 Advice: There should not be any HIV testing without counseling and education.\\nThe patient should be informed about the testing algorithm and the possibilities and\\nlimitations of HIV testing. Particularly, the limitations of the (frequently demanded)\\nHIV PCR in primary diagnostics should be addressed: while a sensitive method for\\ndetection, it is only conditionally suitable for the rapid exclusion of HIV infection\\nor transmission. Due to the distress caused to the patient, the high cost of the PCR\\nas a counter argument against the method is a rare deterrent for the patient. During\\nthe consult, all the possibilities of the test result and in particular the “diagnostic\\nwindow” should be noted. A desired HIV test could also be an occasion to discuss\\nthe risk of transmission in general (also for other sexually transmitted diseases) and\\nappropriate prevention methods with the patient. \\n\\x81 Reporting: A negative test result can possibly be reported by telephone if the patient\\nhas been previously advised of its value. The diagnosis of HIV , however, has to be\\ngiven in a personal counseling interview by a physician (or expert virologist) only\\n(in many places, the result can be given by a registered nurse or counselor). The\\nresponse of a patient cannot be assessed adequately when reporting is done by tele-\\nphone. Sometimes patients can develop suicidal thoughts. Similarly, the negative\\nresult of a confirmatory test following a reactive screening test should be personally\\ndiscussed with regard to the possibility of an acute infection. Patients should be\\ndirected to an HIV-focused practice. In addition, the patient should be advised of\\nregional counseling and care centers. The result of a reactive HIV screening test\\nshould never be reported before the result of the confirmatory test is available.\\n20 The Basics'),\n",

Pathogenesis of HIV-1 Infection\\nRIKA DRAENERT \\n(earlier versions by Andrea Rubbert, Georg Behrens and Mario Ostrowski)\\nSince the initial description of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus type I (HIV-1)\\nin 1983 (Barré-Sinoussi 1983, Gallo 1983) and HIV-2 in 1986 (Clavel 1986), these\\ntwo viruses have been identified as the primary cause of Acquired Immunodeficiency\\nSyndrome (AIDS). As HIV-1 is the major cause of AIDS in the world today, our\\n discussion will be primarily limited to HIV-1 infection. Worldwide, the number of\\nHIV-1-infected persons exceeds 36 million (according to UNAIDS), the majority of\\nwhom live in developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and South America.\\nDespite all the therapeutic advantages achieved over the last decades, including the\\nevolution of “HAART”, once an individual has become infected, eradication of the\\nvirus is not possible. In addition, new problems relating to the short- and long-term\\ntoxicity of drug treatments and the occurrence of resistance mutations in both\\n circulating and transmitted viruses are emerging. In many countries in South East\\nAsia and Africa, the incidence is failing to substantially decline. The prevalence of\\nHIV-1 infection continues to increase and surpass that of Europe and North America. \\nHowever, due to the high costs of drug regimens and the often precarious health-\\ncare infrastructure in these developing countries, the widespread use of ART is\\n currently still partial at best. The further course of the HIV-1 pandemic, therefore,\\nmainly depends on how and to what degree developing countries with a high HIV-\\n1 prevalence are able to take advantage of the medical progress achieved overall, and\\nwhether an effective prophylactic vaccine will become available in the near future\\n(see chapter on Preventive HIV-1 Vaccine).\\nAn understanding of the immunopathogenesis of HIV-1 infection is a major\\n prerequisite for rationally improving therapeutic strategies, developing immunother-\\napeutics and prophylactic vaccines. As in other virus infections, the individual course\\nof HIV-1 infection depends on both host and viral factors.\\nThe course of infection with HIV-1 in HIV-infected humans may vary dramatically,\\neven when primary infection comes from the same source (Liu 1997). In some indi-\\nviduals with a long-term non-progressive HIV-1 infection (i.e., lack of decline in CD4\\nT cell counts, or chronic infection for at least 7 years without the development of\\nAIDS), a defective virion has been identified (Kirchhoff 1995). Thus, infection with\\na defective virus, or one that has a poor capacity to replicate, may prolong the  clinical\\ncourse of HIV-1 infection. However, in most individuals, HIV-1 infection is charac-\\nterized by a replication-competent virus with a high daily turnover of virions. \\nHost factors may also determine whether or not an HIV-1-infected individual rapidly\\ndevelops clinically overt immunodeficiency, or whether this individual belongs to\\nthe group of long-term non-progressors that represents about 5% of all infected\\npatients. The identification and characterization of host factors contributing to the\\ncourse of HIV infection, including immunological defense mechanisms and genetic\\nfactors, will be crucial for our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of HIV\\ninfection and for the development of immunotherapeutic and prophylactic strategies.\\nThe structure of HIV-1\\nHIV-1 is a retrovirus and belongs to the family of lentiviruses. Infections with\\nlentiviruses typically show a chronic course of disease, a long period of clinical\\nlatency, persistent viral replication and involvement of the central nervous system.\\nVisna in sheep, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in monkeys, or feline immun-\\n22'),\n",

However,\\nthey differ with regard to the molecular weight of their proteins, as well as having\\ndifferences in their accessory genes. HIV-2 is genetically more closely related to SIV\\nfound in sooty mangabeys (SIV\\nsm) rather than HIV-1 and it is likely that it was intro-\\nduced into the human population via monkeys. Both HIV-1 and HIV-2 replicate in\\nCD4 T cells and are regarded as pathogenic in infected persons, although the immune\\ndeficiency may be less severe in HIV-2-infected individuals.\\nThe morphologic structure of HIV-1\\nHIV-1 viral particles have a diameter of 120–150 nm and are surrounded by a lipopro-\\ntein membrane. Each viral particle contains up to 72 glycoprotein complexes, which\\nare integrated into this lipid membrane, and are each composed of trimers of an\\nexternal glycoprotein gp120 and a transmembrane spanning protein gp41. The\\nbonding between gp120 and gp41 is only loose and therefore gp120 may be shed\\nspontaneously within the local environment (also called “shedding”). Glycoprotein\\ngp120 can be detected in the serum as well as within the lymphatic tissue of HIV-\\ninfected patients. During the process of budding, the virus may also incorporate\\n different host proteins from the membrane of the host cell into its lipoprotein layer,\\nsuch as HLA class I and II proteins, or adhesion proteins such as ICAM-1 that may\\nfacilitate adhesion to other target cells. The matrix protein p17 is anchored to the\\ninside of the viral lipoprotein membrane. A capsid, composed of roughly 200 copies\\nof the protein p24, encloses two copies of the HIV-1 RNA genome. The HIV-1 RNA\\nis part of a protein-nucleic acid complex, which is composed of the nucleoprotein\\np7 and the reverse transcriptase p66 (RT). The viral particle contains major parts of\\nthe enzymatic equipment necessary for replication: a reverse transcriptase (RT), an\\nintegrase p32 and a protease p11 (Gelderbloom 1993) (Fig. 1).\\nThe organization of the viral genome\\nMost retroviruses contain three genes: gag, pol and env: gag means “group-antigen”,\\npol represents “polymerase” and env is for “envelope” (Wong-Staal 1991) (Fig. 2). The\\nclassical structural scheme of a retroviral genome is: 5’LTR-gag-pol-env-3’LTR. The LTR\\n(long terminal repeat) regions represent the two end parts of the viral genome con-\\nnected to the cellular DNA of the host cell after integration. These do not encode\\nfor viral proteins. This stable integration of the proviral DNA into the host genome\\nleads to a permanent infection. The excision of the proviral DNA out of the human\\ngenome would lead to the cure of HIV infection. This was done by creating an enzyme\\n(HIV-1 long terminal repeat site-specific recombinase), which excises the proviral\\nDNA at the two LTR regions of the genome (Hauber 2013). The investigators were\\nable to show that this enzyme can be expressed in HIV-infected cells and that it can\\nexcise the provirus precisely without harming the host DNA. The results were\\n confirmed in humanized mouse models. For application in humans, the key  question\\nis how to introduce this enzyme into the infected cells.\\nThe gag gene codes for the matrix, capsid and nucleocapsid and env for the glyco-\\nproteins of the viral memebrane; the pol gene codes for the reverse transcriptase and\\nother enzymes. In addition, HIV-1 contains six genes ( vif, vpu, vpr, tat, rev and nef)\\nin its 9kB RNA that contribute to its genetic complexity.

It may induce down-regulation\\nof CD4 and HLA class I molecules (Collins 1998) from the surface of HIV-1-infected\\ncells, which may represent an important escape mechanism for the virus to evade\\nan attack mediated by cytotoxic CD8 T cells and to avoid recognition by CD4 T cells.\\nNef may also interfere with T cell activation by binding to various proteins that are\\ninvolved in intracellular signal transduction pathways (Overview in: Peter 1998). In\\nSIV-infected rhesus macaques, an intact nef gene was essential for a high rate of virus\\nproduction and the progression of disease. HIV-1, with deletions in nef, was identi-\\nfied in a cohort of Australian long-term non-progressors (Kirchhoff 1995). However,\\nmore recent reports indicate that some of these patients are now developing signs\\nof disease progression including a decline of CD4 T cells. Thus, although deletions\\nof the nef gene may slow viral replication, they cannot always prevent the eventual\\ndevelopment of AIDS. Nef is very immunogenic which means that strong immune\\nresponses frequently exist towards this protein.

The binding of gp120 to CD4 is not\\nonly a crucial step for viral entry, but also interferes with intracellular signal trans-\\nduction pathways and promotes apoptosis in CD4 T cells (Banda 1992). \\nInterestingly, monoclonal antibodies against CD4-induced conformational (CD4i)\\nepitopes of gp120 bind well to the gp120 of CD4-independent viruses. This obser-\\nvation suggests that the gp120 of CD4-independent viruses already exposes the\\nregions that are necessary for coreceptor recognition and binding and therefore\\nbinding to CD4 is not a prerequisite of entry for these viruses. CD4-independent\\nviruses are easy to neutralize using the serum of HIV-infected patients, suggesting\\nthat the immune response selects against CD4-independent viruses (Edwards 2001).\\nChemokine receptors as co-receptors for HIV entry\\nThe expression of human CD4 receptors on the surface of a non-human cell line was\\nnot sufficient to allow entry of HIV. Therefore the existence of additional human \\nco-receptors necessary for viral entry was postulated. CD8 T cells from HIV-infected\\npatients are able to suppress viral replication in co-cultures with HIV-infected\\n autologous or allogenic CD4 T cells, and this is independent of their cytotoxic activ-\\nity (Levy 1996). Cocchi identified the chemokines MIP-1\\n/H9251, MIP-1/H9252and Rantes in\\nsupernatants from CD8 T cells derived from HIV-infected patients, and was able to\\nshow that these chemokines were able to suppress replication in a dose-dependent\\nmanner of some, but not all, viral isolates tested (Cocchi 1995). MIP-1\\n/H9251, MIP-1/H9252and\\nRantes are ligands for the chemokine receptor CCR5, and a few months later several\\ngroups were able to show that CCR5 is a necessary co-receptor for monocytotropic\\n(M-tropic) HIV-1 isolates (Deng 1996, Doranz 1996, Dragic 1998). M-tropic HIV-1\\nisolates are classically those viruses that are most easily propagated in macrophage\\ncultures, are unable to infect T cell lines (i.e., immortalized T cells), but are able to\\neasily infect primary T cells from peripheral blood samples. Conversely, T cell-tropic\\nHIV-1 isolates have classically been identified as being those that are easily propa-\\ngated in T cell lines, and grow poorly in macrophages, but are also able to easily\\ninfect primary T cells from peripheral blood samples. It should be noted that both\\nM-tropic and T-tropic HIV-1 variants can easily infect primary human non-immor-\\ntalized T cells in vitro. \\nApproximately at the same time, the chemokine receptor CXCR4 (fusin) was\\ndescribed as being the co-receptor used by T cell-tropic (T-tropic) HIV isolates (Feng\\n1996). SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived factor 1) was identified as the natural ligand of\\nCXCR4 and is able to inhibit the entry of T-tropic HIV-1 isolates into activated CD4\\nT cells. A schematic model is depicted in Fig. 4. T-tropic HIV-1 isolates mainly infect\\nactivated peripheral blood CD4 T cells and cell lines and use CXCR4 for entry into\\nthe CD4-positive target cell. M-tropic isolates are able to infect CD4 T cells, mono-\\ncytes and macrophages, and depend on the use of CCR5 and CD4 for viral entry.\\nThe interaction of gp120 and the cellular receptors is now understood in more detail.\\nGp120 primarily binds to certain epitopes of CD4.

Because the HIV LTR region has\\nmultiple sites for NF-/H9260B, preventing NF-/H9260B migration to the nucleus should inhibit\\nHIV replication. Inhibition of Murr-1 by siRNA is associated with HIV replication in\\nquiescent CD4 T cells (Ganesh 2003). Persistence of HIV in quiescent CD4 T cells\\nand other cellular reservoirs seems one of the main reasons why eradication of HIV\\nis not feasible and why current therapies fail to achieve viral eradication (Dinoso\\n2009, Lewin 2011). A more detailed knowledge of how and when cellular reservoirs\\nof HIV are established and how they may be targeted is of crucial importance for the\\ndevelopment of strategies aiming at HIV eradication.\\nCellular transcription factors such as NF-\\n/H9260B may also bind to the LTR regions. After\\nstimulation with mitogens or cytokines NF-/H9260B is translocated into the nucleus where\\nit binds to the HIV LTR region, thereby initiating transcription of HIV genes.\\nTranscription initially results in the early synthesis of regulatory HIV-1 proteins such\\nas tat or rev. Tat binds to the TAR site (transactivation response element) at the\\n beginning of the HIV-1 RNA in the nucleus and stimulates transcription and the\\n formation of longer RNA transcripts. Rev activates the expression of structural and\\nenzymatic genes and inhibits the production of regulatory proteins, therefore pro-\\nmoting the formation of mature viral particles. \\nThe proteins coded for by pol and gag form the nucleus of the maturing HIV  particle,\\nwhile the gene products coded for by env form the gp120 spikes of the viral  envelope.\\nThe gp120 spikes are synthesized as large gp160 precursor molecules and are cleaved\\nby the HIV-1 protease into gp120 and gp41.

Thus, within\\nany individual, because of the extensive viral replication and mutation rates, there\\nexists an accumulation of many closely-related virus variants within the population\\nof viruses, referred to as a viral quasispecies.\\nHIV and the immune system\\nThe human immune systems consists of many different components. The more\\nresearch is done the more cell types and signaling pathways are described. It is a\\nhighly complex system and we are far from a complete understanding. Here we look\\nat the most important elements of the immune system and their significance for the\\npathogenesis of HIV infection. Studies on immune responses in HIV infection are\\noften performed in patient cohorts with different disease courses before starting anti-\\nretroviral treatment (ART). The most important definitions are:\\n\\x81 Progressors: Individuals who control HIV viremia poorly in the absence of ART.\\nCD4 counts decline continuously and viral loads are medium to high.\\n\\x81 Controllers: Patients who control viremia spontaneously without ART with stable\\nCD4 counts and low viral loads. However viral load definitions vary from study to\\nstudy (e.g., <5000 or <2000 copies/ml).\\n\\x81 Elite controller (EC): Patients who spontaneously control HIV viremia to below\\ndetection levels without ART.\\nInnate immunity\\nThe innate immune response is the first defense mechanism against microorganisms\\nof our body. It is a genetic non-specific reaction towards foreign organisms.\\nEvolutionarily it is old and can be found in all higher organisms. \\nDendritic cells\\nDendritic cells (DC) are derived from myeloid precursor cells of the bone marrow.\\nHowever they are quite heterogeneous as far as localization, surface markers and\\nfunction are concerned. The most important subtypes are myeloid DC and plasma-\\ncytoid DC (Miller 2013, Tsunetsugu-Yokota 2013). The most important function of\\nDCs is their role as professional antigen-presenting cells. For this reason they express\\nhigh levels of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II. DCs are represented in dif-\\nferent tissues and organs, take up antigens and migrate to lymphatic tissues. Therefore\\nthey represent a key function for inducing the adaptive immune response. \\nHIV infection gets started for the most part in rectal or vaginal mucosa. As these\\nmucus membranes are rich in DCs, it is assumed that DCs are the first target of HIV\\n(Piguet 2007). However, HIV producing DCs can rarely be verified in the mucosa\\n(Tsunetsugu-Yokota 2013). Still it is assumed that infected DCs migrate to the lymph\\nnodes or other secondary lymph organs where CD4 T cells are infected with HIV.\\nThey play an important role in primary HIV infection. In the chronic phase of infec-\\ntion, memory T cells are an important reservoir for latent HIV (Pierson 2000). In\\nthese resting CD4 T cells HIV is integrated but does not replicate. Via the interac-\\ntion between DCs and resting CD4 T cells, these CD4 T cells can be activated and\\nHIV replication begins. DCs are therefore also key cells for activation of HIV from\\nlatent reservoirs.\\nHIV-1 itself directly and indirectly influences the function of DCs in order to inhibit\\nthe formation of an effective immune response as well as to force immune activa-\\n32 The Basics'),\n",

Myeloid DCs (mDC) are not able to recognize HIV adequately,\\nleading to the failure of a complete maturation of these cells and consequently lim-\\niting their role in induction of innate and adaptive immune responses (Granelli-\\nPiperno 2004, Sabado 2010, Miller 2012). Only partly mature mDC can lead to the\\nformation of regulatory T cells (Treg) (Krathwohl 2006). In the chronic phase of HIV\\ninfection the function of mDC is clearly limited. The ability to produce IL-12 is a\\ndefect which leads to a restricted differentiation of naïve T cells to Th1 cells (Fan\\n2007, Miller 2012). Plasmacytoid DCs (pDC) are activated strongly by HIV-1 and\\nthey produce interferon-\\n/H9251as a response (Fonteneau 2004, Idoyaga 2011). Ex vivo\\nstudies show increased interferon-/H9251levels by pDC in acute and chronic HIV-1 infec-\\ntion (O’Brien 2011). This is an important contribution to the well-known immune\\nactivation in HIV infection (see chapter on Immune Activation). In spite of this acti-\\nvation, the maturation of pDC is not complete which renders them less effective as\\nantigen-presenting cells (Fonteneau 2004, O’Brien 2011). In addition, HIV-1 induces\\nthe production of indoleamine-2, 3-dioxigenase (IDO) in pDC which leads to further\\ninduction of Treg (Manches 2008). This limits HIV-specific immune responses\\nalthough it can improve immune activation.\\nThe effects of HIV-1 on DC are well described (Miller 2013). However even this short\\nchapter the different and partly contrary roles that DC play in HIV infection are\\nhighlighted. This renders them an important component with regard to therapeu-\\ntic and prophylactic vaccines. \\nNatural killer (NK) cells \\nNK cells are lymphocytes not considered T or B lymphocytes nor do they express\\nantigen-specific receptors. They are important in the control of viruses and malig-\\nnant tumors and belong to the innate immune system. NK cells express many\\n different receptors, toll-like receptors (TLR) and killer immunoglobulin-like recep-\\ntors (KIR) among them. KIR recognize HLA class I molecules on healthy cells which\\nprotect these cells against NK cell attack.\\nNK cells can eliminate HIV-infected cells rapidly either via direct cytolysis or via\\nsecretion of cytokines (Walker 2013). Population-wide genetic studies show an impor-\\ntant influence of NK cells on disease progression (Jost 2013). Certain parts of the\\nHLA class I alleles (mainly Bw4) lead to a slower disease progression (Flores-Villanueva\\n2001). This effect is even stronger when combined with KIR3DL1 (Martin 2007). In\\naddition, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) within the HLA-C allele have been\\nidentified which influence disease progression. The HLA-C molecule is the ligand\\nfor the KIR2D receptor and thereby influences the function of NK cells (Jost 2013). \\nNK cells put selective pressure on the virus which can lead to escape mutations (Alter\\n2011). In HIV infection, different functional and phenotypical changes of NK cells\\nhave been found. Most of those are induced by a high viral load and consequently\\nstrong immune activation (Walker 2013). Interestingly, the antiviral activity of NK\\ncells of elite controllers is relatively weak which implies that the contribution of NK\\ncells to the control of viremia in these patients is rather low (O’Connell 2009). \\n/H9253/H9254T cells\\n/H9253/H9254T cells belong to the family of T cells, but they separate in the early phases of \\nT cell development (before maturation in the thymus) (Fig. 6).

These cells are therefore associated with the innate immune\\nsystem.\\nTypically, the number of V\\n/H92532V/H92542 TCR-bearing /H9253/H9254T cells is reduced in early HIV\\ninfection. Both the extent of the loss of these cells and their loss of function corre-\\nlate with disease progression (Wallace 1997). Surprisingly, these cells are maintained\\nin the peripheral blood of EC in high numbers and comparable to healthy controls\\n(Riedel 2009). It was also shown that V\\n/H92532V/H92542 T cells were reduced in EC in the early\\ndisease phase. However, the cells were able to recover numerically with a normal\\nfunction. This is a phenomenon that distinguishes EC of other people living with\\nHIV. However, the authors tested only 21 individuals in this study. Therefore, it is\\nworthwhile to pursue this in larger cohorts and to develop mechanisms that lead to\\nthe recovery of these cell types.\\nAdaptive immunity\\nIn contrast to the innate immune system, the adaptive immune response cannot\\ndirectly eliminate microorganisms. The adaptive immune system has to learn to\\n recognize foreign pathogens und represents the second line of defense in our body.\\nParts of this system are also inherited (e.g., the HLA alleles). Others, the T cell recep-\\ntors among them, are formed individually by rearrangement.\\nThe HLA system\\nThe system of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) comprises a group of membrane-\\nbound receptors which present antigens for the TCR of the adaptive immune system.\\nThey are encoded in 40 genes on chromosome 6. The HLA genes that are immuno-\\nlogically important are divided into two classes, namely class I and II, which differ\\nstructurally and functionally (review: Klein 2000). The HLA class I alleles A, B and\\nC are expressed on all somatic cells and present antigens for CD8 T cells. The complex\\nHLA class II alleles are named with three letters: D for the class; M, O, P, Q or R for\\nthe family and A or B for the respective chain (\\n/H9251or /H9252). An example for an HLA class\\nII receptor is HLA-DRB1. HLA class II alleles are only expressed by certain immune\\ncells, e.g., B lymphocytes, activated T lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells.\\nThey present antigens for CD4 T cells. Via the presentation of short antigenic pep-\\ntides, the “learning process” of the adaptive immune response is started.\\nA correlation between certain HLA class I alleles and control of HIV infection has\\nbeen postulated in HIV research. Among those are the HLA class I alleles B*57, B*58:01\\nand B*27 (O’Brien 2001). Interestingly, a genome-wide analysis of HIV infected\\npersons again resulted in the identification of just these HLA class I alleles as being\\nassociated with control of viremia (Pereyra 2010). Indirectly, this is proof of the sig-\\nnificance of CD8 T cell responses for the control of HIV infection. It is striking that\\nthe allele B*57 on the one hand often leads to a good spontaneous control of HIV\\ninfection, but that it predestines to hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir on the other\\nhand (Mallal 2002). There is also an association of HLA-B*35 and B*07 with rapid\\nHIV disease progression (O’Brien 2001). Much less data exists concerning HLA class\\nII alleles and their impact on HIV infection. However, variants have been described\\nthat have a favorable effect on the disease process, e.g., variants of the HLA-DRB1\\n(Ranasinghe 2013).\\nHLA class I alleles interact also with receptors of the innate immune system, for\\nexample, KIRs on NK cells, and this could have an impact on the control of HIV. But\\nit has not yet been shown that controllers carry particularly favorable HLA-KIR com-\\nbinations (O’Connell 2009). In addition HLA class I alleles bind to “leucocyte\\nimmunoglobulin-like receptors” (LILR), which are expressed on dendritic cells\\n34 The Basics'),\n",

So far, however, it is not clear whether HLA LILR inter-\\nactions affect HIV disease progression.\\nCD8 T cells\\nIn the development of T lymphocytes, CD8 T cells separate from CD4 T cells in the\\nthymus (Fig. 6). After a phase where the T lymphocytes are positive for both CD4\\nand CD8 receptors, one of the two receptors is down-regulated and either CD4\\n positive or CD8 positive T cells develop. The predominant task of CD8 cells is cyto-\\ntoxicity, i.e., they eliminate virus-infected cells. Additionally, they secrete a number\\nof cytokines and chemokines, including MIP-1\\n/H9252, interferon-/H9253, TNF-/H9251and IL-2. They\\nexert their function via their T cell receptor (TCR) recognizing the antigen in the\\nHLA class I molecule. The T cell receptor of the CD8 cells (and also of CD4 cells)\\nconsists of an \\n/H9251- and a /H9252-chain (as opposed to the /H9253/H9254T cells). The /H9251-chain recom-\\nbines from 42 variable (V) segments and 61 “joining” (J) segments; the /H9252-chain\\nrecombines from 47 V segments, 2 “diversity” (D) segments and 13 J segments. Since\\nadditional nucleotide additions or deletions occur at the junction of the two chains,\\na huge number (~10\\n15) of diverse T cell receptors is guaranteed. However, only a\\n fraction of them, about several thousand, meet a matching antigen during the life-\\ntime of an individual (Arstila 1999).\\nHIV-specific CD8 cells were described early after the discovery of HIV. Back in 1987,\\ntwo groups reported the discovery of cytotoxic T cells that eliminate HIV (Plata 1987,\\nWalker 1987). Today we know that virus-specific CD8 cells are very important for\\nthe control of viremia.\\nThis is due to, among other reasons, the strong association between certain HLA\\nclass I alleles and slow disease progression. In particular, for individuals with HLA-\\nB*27 an epitope within Gag was defined which is responsible for viremic control.\\nMutations in this epitope are so devastating to the virus that it only leads to repli-\\ncation competent viruses if a compensatory mutation arises far from this epitope\\nPathogenesis of HIV-1 Infection    35\\nFigure 7: Development of B and T lymphocytes'),\n",

It appears to be different for patients with the\\nHLA-B*57 allele: there are epitopes which rapidly escape after infection. This leads\\nto a restriction of the replicative capacity of the virus and to the consequent control\\nof viremia (Leslie 2004).\\nCD8 T cell responses exist in all HIV-infected patients and the variety of epitopes is\\nimmense (Addo 2003). From twins studies we know when the same virus hits the\\nsame immune system, the immune response is very similar (Draenert 2006). As a\\nreaction to the immune pressure by a strong CD8 T cell response, viral variants with\\nsequence changes arise, so-called escape mutations. This occurs most frequently in\\nearly HIV infection, which was shown nicely both in the monkey model and in\\nhumans (Allen 2000, O’Connor 2002, Allen 2005).\\nAlso, in late disease stages, there are CD8 T cell responses, sometimes broad and\\nstrong (Draenert 2004). However, these usually do not induce escape mutations,\\nwhich is an indirect indication that these responses are no longer effective (Draenert\\n2004). Consequently, the CD8 T cell response was examined not only quantitatively\\nbut also qualitatively. It turned out that “controllers” usually have a poly-functional\\nCD8 T cell response, i.e., CD8 cells have many different effector functions (MIP-1\\n/H9252,\\ninterferon-/H9253, TNF-/H9251, IL-2 and cytotoxicity). On the other hand “progressors” have\\nCD8 cells that reply to an antigen stimulus with only one or two functions (Betts\\n2006). It has also been shown that effective CD8 cells of “controllers” proliferate\\nwell ex vivo, unlike those of “progressors” (Migueles 2002). This loss of effector func-\\ntions is called immune exhaustion. It leads to an ineffective T cell response.\\nIn recent years, causes of immune exhaustion have been studied. It was shown that\\ninhibitory signaling pathways, especially programmed death-1 (PD-1), play a major\\nrole in the development of immune exhaustion (Day 2006, Petrovas 2006, Trautmann\\n2006). By blocking PD-1, proliferation of CD8 T cells increased significantly (Day\\n2006). Other inhibitory molecules are Tim-3 and CD244 (2B4) (Jones 2008, Pacheco\\n2013). In addition, new cell types that suppress immune responses play a role.\\nRecently it was demonstrated that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), which\\ninhibit immune responses in solid tumors, occur in increased number of HIV-infected\\npersons and restrict the function of CD8 cells ex vivo (Vollbrecht 2012, Qin 2013).\\nCD4 T cells\\nT lymphocytes that keep the CD4 receptor during T cell development, undergo\\nfurther maturation in the thymus. They are divided into various sub-groups, which\\ndiffer in their phenotype and function. In the thymus, a clearly separated subgroup\\nsplits off: the regulatory T cells (Fig. 6). What remains are the naïve CD4 T cells which\\ncan develop into four (and possibly more) cell lines, depending on the stimulus:\\nTh1, Th2, Th17 and “follicular helper T cells” (TFH). The latter mediate B cell acti-\\nvation in the B cell follicles of the secondary lymphoid organs (Papp 2014). Best\\nknown are the true CD4 helper cells, namely Th1 and Th2 cells, which differ in their\\ncytokine profile and also have different functions: Th1 cells mainly produce inter-\\nferon \\n/H9253, lymphotoxin /H9251(LT/H9251) and IL-2 and are considered crucial for fighting intra-\\ncellular pathogens. Th2 cells on the other hand produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, \\nIL-13, IL-25 and amphiregulin. They aim at extracellular pathogens, including worms\\n(Zhu 2008). CD4 T cells carry an \\n/H9251/H9252T cell receptor as described for the CD8 T cells\\nwhich interacts distinctly from HLA class II molecules.\\nCD4 helper cells are important for the development of an effective CD8 T cell and\\nB cell response. There are also directly acting antigen-specific CD4 cells. Since these\\ncells are preferentially infected by HIV , it was not clear initially whether they func-\\ntion properly in HIV infection. Today we know that virus-specific CD4 T cell responses\\n(Th1) lose effector functions early in HIV infection, including, e.g., IL-2 production\\n36 The Basics'),\n",

The function\\nof HIV-specific CD4 cells of elite controllers is significantly better than in patients\\nwith progressive disease (Betts 2001, Younes 2003, Harari 2004, Pereyra 2008).\\nHowever, it has been shown that the differences in function are at least partly the\\nconsequence and not the cause of the low viral load of elite controllers (Harari 2004,\\nPotter 2007, Tilton 2007).\\nFor the CD4 T cell response, an important determinant is immune exhaustion as\\nwas already described for CD8 T cells. For CD4 T cells, the inhibitory molecule PD-\\n1 also plays an important role (D’Souza 2007). Several inhibitory synergistic signal-\\ning pathways are responsible for the loss of function of CD4 T cells, in particular,\\nCTLA-4 and TIM-3 (Jones 2008, Kassu 2010). Cytokine IL-10 has been identified as\\na crucial mediator (Clerici 1994, Brockman 2009). Blockade of the IL-10 receptor by\\nan antibody resulted in improved proliferation of CD4 T cells as well as to an increased\\nsecretion of IL-2 and interferon-\\n/H9253.\\nRegulatory T cells (Treg)\\nRegulatory T cells are CD4 and CD25-positive T cells which mature within the thymus\\n(Fig. 6). They show a pronounced suppressive activity (suppressor cells), and inhibit\\nthe activation, proliferation, and function of a number of immune cells, including\\nCD4 and CD8 T cells, NK cells, B cells and antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic\\ncells and macrophages (Imamichi 2012, Josefowicz 2012). They protect the body\\nagainst building harmful immune responses against self, foods or commensal\\n(Josefowicz 2012), protecting against autoimmune diseases or allergies.\\nThe role of Treg in HIV infection is an area of   intense research, as well as debate.\\nThere are conflicting data on the benefits or harm of Treg in the pathogenesis of HIV\\ninfection. There are studies describing increasing, comparable or decreasing Treg\\nnumbers in HIV infection in comparison to healthy individuals (Seddiki 2008). These\\ninconsistencies can be explained by different phenotypic markers or methods of\\ncounting (percentage or absolute numbers). In addition the stage of HIV infection\\nand the compartment in which cells are measured, play a role. Recently, however,\\nit was shown that the absolute number of Treg decreases over the course of HIV infec-\\ntion, while their percentage within CD4 T cells increases. The function of Treg seems\\nto be unaffected in HIV infection (Angin 2012, Mendez-Lagares 2012, Simonetta\\n2012). At the moment, there is no data showing that Tregs suppress the immune\\nresponse to HIV. Recently, HIV-specific Tregs were detected for the first time (Angin\\n2012). In conclusion, this is a cell type that needs to be studied more closely before\\nconclusions about therapeutic options can be drawn.\\nTh17 cells\\nTh17 cells develop from naive CD4 cells in the thymus (Fig. 6). They were named\\nafter their IL-17 secretion which represents part of their function. They protect the\\nbody against a range of pathogens and can be found mainly in the mucosa and skin.\\nThey reach their destination via the homing receptor CCR6 (Elhed 2010).\\nThe function of Th17 cells in HIV infection has been incompletely understood.\\nWhether Th17 cells may have a direct antiviral effect is unclear (Brenchley 2008,\\nYue 2008). It may depend on the disease stage if HIV-specific Th17 cells can be found\\nor not. More is known about their barrier function in the gut. The intestinal mucosa\\nrepresents an important guard against invading pathogens. It is clear that Th17 cells\\nare reduced in the colonic mucosa of HIV-infected people, which contributes to the\\nweakening of the mucosal barrier (Brenchley 2008). This leads to an increased excre-\\ntion of microbial products into the blood which increases immune activation.\\nTherefore Th17 cells are causally involved in the pathologic immune activation in\\nPathogenesis of HIV-1 Infection    37'),\n",

However, it could also be shown that Th17 cells are reconstituted in\\nthe intestine after starting ART, although not to the same level as in healthy sub-\\njects (Macal 2008, Kim 2013). By administering IL-21, the protective function of the\\nintestine could be recovered by increased Th17 cell numbers in SIV-infected rhesus\\nmacaques (Pallikkuth 2013).\\nHumoral immune response\\nNew B cells are formed in the bone marrow throughout life. When mature B cells\\nform, they leave the bone marrow and migrate to the secondary lymphoid organs\\n(e.g., spleen, lymph nodes and Peyer’s patches in the gut). After antigen challenge,\\na further maturation phase ensues, which leads to the formation of the humoral\\nimmune response. Newly derived plasma cells produce diverse antibodies. The\\nrecombination of the light or heavy chains of the immunoglobulins is very similar\\nto the process of rearrangement of the T cell receptors. A distinction is made between\\nneutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies. Neutralization is considered the main\\nmechanism to combat a pathogen and is mediated either by blocking a cellular receptor\\nor by blocking the fusion of the virus (Corti 2013). Non-neutralizing antibodies help\\nprotect against pathogens, e.g., by recruiting effector cells or complement cells (Corti 2013).\\nNatural HIV infection first induces non-neutralizing antibodies (nNAK) and neu-\\ntralizing antibodies (NAK) which are specific for a certain viral strain. These can be\\ndetected soon after infection (via HIV testing). However, the virus is always one step\\nahead of these antibodies by developing escape mutations. This leads to the diver-\\nsification of Env in early infection (Frost 2005). These antibodies barely contribute\\nto the control of viremia.\\nIn recent years, however, the discovery of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAK)\\nled to new optimism. Up to 20% of all infected individuals build bNAK during the\\ncourse of disease that can reach various strains of HIV effectively. However bNAK\\noccur relatively late in the disease process, a minimum of two years after infection\\n(Kwong 2013). The target of bNAK is the viral spike of the HIV-1 viral envelope, a\\nheterodimer consisting of trimeric gp120 and the transmembrane glycoprotein gp41.\\nMost bNAK bind to one of the following four binding sites (Kwong 2012): \\n\\x81 antibodies directed against the CD4 binding site that recognize the binding site of\\nthe CD4 receptor to gp120; \\n\\x81 antibodies directed against the variable region of V1 or V2 that often recognize\\n glycopeptide epitopes near amino acid Asn160 on gp120; \\n\\x81 antibodies directed against V3 that recognize epitopes that contain the amino acid\\nAsn332 within gp120; and \\n\\x81 antibodies directed against the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) that\\nrecognize a position of gp41 proximal to the transmembrane region.\\nbNAK are unique in that they do not arise from a primary antigen contact, but have\\nto mature further through additional antigenic contacts (Kwong 2013).

Attempts to induce bNAK by vaccination were unsuccessful. This\\nis certainly due to the fact that the right immunogen has not been found yet.\\nHowever, research is very intense in this field (Kwong 2013).\\nIn addition to the induction of bNAK by vaccination, bNAK can be passively trans-\\nferred in order to control infection. This has been successfully done in humanized\\nmice and in macaques (Moldt 2012, Horwitz 2013). Data in infected individuals are\\nunder way. Despite the euphoria surrounding bNAK, it should be noted that several\\nstudies in elite controllers detected bNAK to a lesser degree than in viremic pro-\\ngressors (Bailey 2006, Pereyra 2008, Lambotte 2009, Doria-Rose 2010). Other studies\\nhave also shown that a wider range of bNAK is typically associated with higher viral\\nload and that this does not protect against disease progression (Deeks 2006, Sather\\n2009, Euler 2010).\\nMucosal immunity\\nSince HIV infection is usually transmitted via the mucous membrane (mostly\\n vaginally or rectally), the immune system of the mucous membranes needs to be\\nmentioned. The gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is the largest immune organ\\nof the body. Due to its high content of CD4 cells, the GALT is also the main target\\nfor HIV. The massive CD4 T cell depletion during early HIV infection leads to the\\nmicrobial translocation which in turn leads to increased immune activation\\n(Brenchley 2004+2006). The latter is pathognomonic of chronic HIV infection.\\nHowever, the T cell response of the mucosa was found to be a correlate for the control\\nof viremia in recent years (Shacklett 2011). In the mucous membranes, virus-specific\\nT cells among others can be found. HIV-specific CD8 T cells were detected in abun-\\ndance in the rectal mucosa as demonstrated in chronically HIV-infected individuals\\n(Shacklett 2003, Ibarrondo 2005). Here a correlation between viral load and poly-\\nfunctionality of the CD8 T cell responses could be demonstrated (Critchfield 2008).\\nElite controllers had significantly higher CD8 T cell responses with more effector\\nfunctions in the rectal mucosa than progressors, whereas no difference in the CD8\\nT cell responses in peripheral blood was found (Ferre 2009). This shows that many\\ncontrollers have strong, polyfunctional CD8 (and also CD4) T cell responses in the\\nintestinal mucosa – a fact that is not reflected in the peripheral blood. Polyfunctional\\nCD4 T cells also correlate with a high CD4 cell count and a good control of viremia,\\nbut the CD4 T cells were only non-specifically stimulated in the respective studies\\n(Loke 2010).\\nNK cells were shown to be reduced in the intestine in chronic HIV infection. However,\\na subset of these cells remained stable in controllers. Interestingly, intestinal NK cells\\nwere significantly increased in patients who did not achieve a complete CD4 T cell\\nrecovery after the start of suppressive ART. In this situation, NK cells might expand\\nin the gut in an effort to compensate for the CD4 cell loss (Sips 2012). In ART-naïve\\npatients, it was demonstrated that pDCs accumulate in the terminal ileum and are\\naccompanied by elevated levels of interferon-alpha. In that way pDC could con-\\ntribute to the development of immune activation. Both parameters were normalized\\nafter the start of ART (Lehmann 2014).\\nAnother aspect of mucosal immunity is the fact that the intestinal mucosa is an\\nimportant reservoir of HIV. Two large studies have shown that in patients with effec-\\ntive ART and a viral load below 40 HIV RNA copies/ml HIV continue to be detectable\\nin the intestinal mucosa (Chun 2008, Yukl 2010). So far, proviral DNA has not been\\nstudied in the gut in controllers or elite controllers. The fact that strong T cell\\nresponses can be detected in this compartment in patients with good control of HIV\\nviremia is an indirect indication that antigen can still be found. T cell responses tend\\nto grow weaker up to undetectable when the antigen disappears (Ferre 2009 + 2010).\\nPathogenesis of HIV-1 Infection    39'),\n",

In most cases, it is switched off after elimination of the pathogen. For\\nseveral years, it has been known that a persistent immune activation is one of the\\noutstanding features of chronic progressive HIV infection and significantly con-\\ntributes to the pathogenesis of the disease. In fact, the level of immune activation\\nis the best prognostic marker for the disease progression regardless of viral load\\n(Miedema 2013). Affected are the T lymphocytes that express the markers CD38 and\\nHLA-DR when activated. In addition, an increased expression of pro-inflammatory\\ncytokines, including Type I interferons (e.g., interferon-\\n/H9251), IL-6, TGF-/H9252, IL-8, IL-1/H9251\\nand IL-1/H9252, and inflammatory markers such as sCD14, CRP, cystatin C, and D-dimer\\n(Deeks 2011). These markers are elevated not only in the blood. It was demonstrated\\nthat immune activation markers in blood and intestines were well correlated (Loke\\n2010).\\nCause of the immune activation is – amongst other reasons – due to the pathology\\nof HIV infection in the gut. The destruction and depletion of CD4 T cells in the intes-\\ntine leads to an increased permeability of the gut for microbial products. Specifically,\\nLPS was measured in increased levels (Brenchley 2004, Li 2005, Brenchley 2006). LPS\\nactivates the innate immune system via toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (Brenchley 2006,\\nGordon 2010). However, other microbial products such as flagellin, peptidoglycan\\nand bacterial CpG-rich DNA domains contribute to immune activation via reactions\\nwith TLR-2, -5 and -9 (Brenchley 2006). More recently, it was shown that pDC in\\nthe intestines of HIV-infected individuals produce increased interferon-\\n/H9251leading to\\nan increased immune activation in the gut (Lehmann 2014).\\nHIV itself has been identified as another cause of immune activation. Single-stranded\\nHIV RNA can activate pDCs directly via TLR-7 and -8 leading to the production of\\ninterferon-\\n/H9251(Fonteneau 2004, Beignon 2005, Meier 2007). Additionally, NK cells\\ncan be activated by single-stranded HIV RNA and this process is dependent on the\\ncell-cell contact of pDCs and monocytes (Alter 2007). Type I interferons are pro-\\nduced by pDCs in large quantities and are an essential link between the innate and\\nacquired immune systems. In most cases pDCs become refractory to TLR stimula-\\ntion, which stops interferon-\\n/H9251production. It has been shown, however, that HIV\\nleads to the induction of only partially mature pDCs which are no longer refractory,\\nbut continuously produce interferon-\\n/H9251(O’Brien 2011).\\nConsequences of immune activation are an increasing loss of CD4 T cells and the\\ndestruction of the HIV-specific immune response as described above. However, the\\nemergence of other diseases is also favored by this persistent immune activation.\\nParticular examples are cardiovascular events, non-alcoholic hepatic steatosis, renal\\ndysfunction, osteoporosis, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and neurocogni-\\ntive disorders (Hsueh 2006 + 2009, Deeks 2011). While our knowledge is still defi-\\ncient, some mediators of immune activation are known. This is important for new\\ntherapeutic strategies targeting immune activation (Miedema 2013).\\nReferences\\nAddo MM, Yu XG, Rathod A, et al.

Preventive HIV-1 Vaccine\\nTHOMAS HARRER\\nAlthough great progress has been achieved in the field of treatment and prevention\\nof HIV-1 infection, the HIV-1 pandemic will ultimately be controlled only by an\\neffective HIV-1 vaccine. The following chapter will give a short overview of the\\ncurrent status of HIV-1 vaccine development. \\nInduction of neutralizing antibodies\\nSimilar to successful vaccination strategies in other infections, initial HIV-1 vaccine\\nresearch focussed on the development of vaccines with the capability of inducing\\nneutralizing antibodies. A variety of studies examined the safety and efficacy of\\n vaccines such as gp120, gp160, parts of gp160 and peptides from gp160 to induce\\nantibodies against HIV-1 envelope proteins. These immunogens stimulated the\\n production of specific antibodies that were able to neutralize HIV-1 strains in vitro,\\nbut they failed to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies in HIV-1 variants derived\\nfrom patients (Mascola 1996). \\nTwo gp120-based vaccines were tested in two large Phase III trials in healthy volun-\\nteers: a clade B gp120 from HIV-1 MN and a gp120 from the CRF01_AE HIV-1 isolate\\nwere used in the VAX 003 Study in Thailand (Pitisuttithum 2006), while clade B\\ngp120 proteins from HIV-1 MN and HIV-1 GNE8 were tested in the VAX 004 Study\\nin the USA and the Netherlands (Flynn 2005). Despite induction of antibodies against\\ngp120, the incidence of new infections was not lowered in either trial. These studies\\nand others demonstrate that it is difficult to neutralize the biological activity of the\\nenvelope molecule gp160 via antibodies. Prior to the binding of gp120 to the CD4\\nreceptor, the conserved and functionally important epitopes are hidden in grooves\\nof the gp120 molecules that are additionally masked by glycan shields and variable\\nsequence loops (Kwong 2002). Therefore, it is difficult for antibodies to block the\\nbinding of gp120 to the CD4 molecule. \\nThe binding of the gp120 trimer to CD4 induces a conformational change of the V3\\nloop that exposes a conserved high-affinity coreceptor binding site on the gp120\\nmolecule. The subsequent binding to the coreceptors CCR5 or CXCR4 triggers struc-\\ntural modifications of the viral transmembrane molecule gp41 and starts the fusion\\nof the virus with the host cell membrane. Antibodies against the V3 loop can\\n neutralize the process, although these activated binding sites on the V3 loop are\\n recognizable by antibodies only for a short period of time. Therefore, high antibody\\nconcentrations are required for an efficient neutralization. Another problem for anti-\\nbody-mediated neutralization is the shielding of the V3 loop-coreceptor interaction\\nsite by the gp120 trimer, which also inhibits the binding of antibodies to the V3\\nloop (Labrijn 2003). \\nApproximately 30% of the HIV-1 infected patients generate neutralizing antibodies\\nwithin two to three years after infection. However, in the majority of patients they\\nare directed against the gp120 variable sequences. Due to the high sequence\\n variability in gp120, HIV-1 can evade antibodies by a rapid generation of escape\\nmutants. Thus, the majority of patients generate antibodies recognizing their own\\nstrain of HIV-1, but they neutralize HIV-1 variants from other patients poorly. There\\nare only a few patients able to produce highly effective broadly cross-reacting neu-\\ntralizing antibodies (bnAbs). These exceptional antibodies recognize the conserved\\nbinding site for CD4 in gp120 (antibodies: B12, PGT121, VRC01, VRC03, 3BNC117),\\na  particular pattern of glycans in gp120 (2G12 antibody), the V1/V2 loops (PG9 and\\n46'),\n",

The\\nmajority of the bnAbs show unusual characteristics such as a long complementarity-\\ndetermining region 3 (CDR3) in the heavy-chain variable (VH) region, a large number\\nof somatic mutations and polyreactivity with non-HIV-1 antigens (McMichael 2012).\\nThe requirement of affinity maturation of these antibodies and immune tolerance\\nagainst polyreactive antibodies are probably important reasons that only approxi-\\nmately 20% of chronically infected patients are able to generate bnAbs and that these\\nbnAbs emerge usually only after several years of infection.\\nVaccination with a recombinant gp120 molecule is not able to induce antibodies\\nagainst the V3 loop, as the V3 loop epitopes in the native gp120 molecule are not\\naccessible to antibodies. To improve the induction of antibodies targeting the V3\\nloop, attempts are currently in progress to develop fusion molecules consisting of\\ngp120 and CD4 that simulate the conformational changes in gp120 after binding to\\nthe CD4 molecule (Kwong 1998).\\nAn innovative approach is the passive genetic immunization by the transfer of genes\\nencoding highly active neutralizing antibodies or antibody-like immunoadhesins.\\nIn rhesus monkeys, the intramuscular injection of a recombinant adeno-associated\\nvirus (AAV) vector encoding such SIV-specific antibody genes could induce the \\nin vivoproduction of SIV envelope-specific neutralizing antibody constructs that pro-\\nvided protection from intravenous challenge with SIV (Johnson 2009). Using a new\\nself-complementary AAV (scAAV) vector for transfer of genes coding for neutralizing\\nantibodies, protection from HIV-1 infection could be achieved in a humanized mouse\\nmodel, too (Balazs 2012). This exciting new development stimulated a worldwide\\nsearch for those few HIV-1 infected individuals who were able to generate unique\\nhighly active neutralizing antibodies which could be used for genetic immunization\\nagainst HIV-1. The discovery of a panel of highly active broadly neutralizing\\n antibodies provided the opportunity to test the activity of such broadly  neutralizing\\nantibodies in vivo in rhesus monkeys infected with SHIV , a chimeric SIV in which\\nthe SIV envelope has been replaced by an HIV-1 envelope. The infusion of a\\n combination of monoclonal antibodies and even the sole application of the N332-\\ndependent antibody PGT121 suppressed the SHIV plasma viremia below the limit\\nof detection (Barouch 2013, Shingai 2013). A recent study in humans analyzed the\\nantiviral activity and safety of the 3BNC117 antibody which is a potent CD4 binding\\nsite antibody cloned from a viremic controller. A single 30 mg/kg infusion of\\n3BNC117 was well tolerated and led to a reduction of HIV-1 viral load by 0.8 – \\n2.5 log copies/ml in HIV-1 infected viremic patients (Caskey 2015). Although resist-\\nance emerged in some patients, passive antibody transfer could be useful not only\\nfor treatment of HIV+ patients but also for prevention of mother-to-child  trans -\\nmission. \\nInduction of HIV-1-specific T cells\\nWith all these hurdles regarding the induction of neutralizing antibody responses,\\nthe focus of vaccine development turned to vaccines that could elicit HIV-1-specific\\nT cell responses. Cytotoxic T cells (CTL) play an important role in the control of\\nHIV-1 in humans (Koup 1994, Harrer 1996b, Pantaleo 1997) and for the control of\\nSIV in SIV models. Experimental depletion of CD8 T cells in SIV-infected monkeys\\nabrogated immune control of SIV infection and was associated with a strong increase\\nof viral replication (Schmitz 1999). In contrast to neutralizing antibodies, CTLs do\\nnot exert a sterilizing immunity as they can only recognize cells that are already\\ninfected. \\nPreventive HIV-1 Vaccine    47'),\n",

Even if a T cell-based vaccine could not prevent infec-\\ntion of the host, there is the chance that it could influence the course of infection\\nby reducing the extent of viremia after infection, as seen in the SIV monkey models\\n(Letvin 2006). The viral load four months after infection, also known as the viral\\nsetpoint, may be one of the most important prognostic parameters for the course of\\nHIV-1 infection. A vaccine could provide a clinical benefit if it could reduce the viral\\nsetpoint by half a log (Johnston 2007). In addition, such a vaccine could possibly\\nexert positive effects on the spread of the HIV epidemic, as a lower viremia proba-\\nbly diminishes the infectivity of the patients. The clinical evaluation of these  vaccines\\nthat do not prevent infection, but rather influence the course of disease, is difficult\\nto achieve as large numbers of patients must be followed for extended periods of\\ntime. \\nHIV-1 can evade CTL recognition via development of CTL escape mutants in T cell\\nepitopes or in proteasome cleavage sites (Maurer 2008). At least in conserved  proteins\\nsuch as gag or protease CTL-mediated immune selection is a major driving force for\\nthe development of polymorphisms (Mueller 2007). Our observations in long-term\\nnon-progressors showed that the quality of the CTL response with recognition of\\nconserved CTL epitopes is very important (Harrer 1996a, Wagner 1999). It is essen-\\ntial for an effective vaccine to contain enough highly conserved CTL epitopes for\\nthe individual HLA alleles. \\nCTLs can be induced only by vaccines that are able to load viral peptides on HLA\\nclass I molecules of dendritic cells which present these peptides to CTLs. Live\\n attenuated viruses are effective against several infectious pathogens such as measles\\nand they were protective against SIV in rhesus monkeys, but they are unlikely to be\\nused in humans due to safety concerns. DNA vaccines alone are not very immuno-\\ngenic in humans, but in DNA prime/vector boost strategies DNA priming could\\nincrease the immunogenicity of subsequent vaccinations with viral vectors.\\nLipopeptides allow the induction of CTL, but they can present only a limited\\n repertoire of epitopes. \\nA new concept is the genetic immunization by transfer of genes encoding highly\\neffective HIV-1-specific T cell receptors (TCR) into CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. In  contrast\\nto the transfer of antibody genes, transfer of TCR has to consider the HLA  restriction\\nof the targeted CTL epitope and the HLA-I type of the recipient. It has been shown\\nin in vitro experiments that it is even possible to transfer two different exogenous\\nHIV-1-specific TCRs into the same cell. If such techniques could be applied also in\\nvivo, this could reduce the risk of selection of CTL escape mutations (Hofmann 2011).\\nRecombinant viral vectors\\nRecombinant vectors can achieve the induction of CTLs without the safety risks of\\nattenuated live viruses. Several vectors have been tested in clinical studies: adeno -\\nvirus 5 (Ad5) vectors, ALVAC canarypox viruses, MVA (Harrer 2005), NYVAC (Gomez\\n2007a+b), adenovirus-associated virus and fowlpox vectors.\\nA great disappointment was the termination of two placebo-controlled Phase IIb\\ntrials, the HVTN 502 study (STEP trial) (Buchbinder 2008) and the HVTN 503 study\\n(Phambili Study) (Gray 2011). Both studies tested Merck’s trivalent MRK Ad5 vaccine\\n(V520), a mixture of Ad5 vectors expressing HIV-1 gag, pol and nef.

Nevertheless, the study was terminated ahead of schedule in\\nSeptember 2007 because of lack of efficacy. The vaccine neither prevented HIV-1\\ninfection nor did it lower the viral setpoint in those who were infected. In total, 83\\nvolunteers became infected during the trial. As only one female was infected, the\\npost hoc analyses were restricted to the 82 male newly-infected subjects. There was\\na non-significant trend towards a greater number of infections in the vaccine\\n recipients (49 new infections in 914 subjects) versus the placebo recipients (33 new\\ninfections in 922 subjects). Interestingly, subjects with high pre-existing Ad5-\\nspecific neutralizing antibody titers (titer of >200) at enrolment showed a higher\\ninfection rate in those who got the vaccine (21 infections) versus those in the placebo\\narm (9 infections). In contrast there were no significant differences in subjects with\\nabsent or low Ad5-specific neutralizing antibody titers of /H11349200 (28 infections in the\\nvaccine arm, 24 infections in the placebo arm). Because of the potential risk of the\\nMRK Ad5 vaccine in subjects with a strong immune response against adenovirus 5,\\nthe parallel Phambili trial in South Africa was terminated as well. In Phambili, the\\nMRK Ad5 vaccine showed no efficacy, with 33 new HIV-1 infections (4.54 infections\\nper 100 person-years) in patients receiving at least one vaccination versus 28 HIV-1\\ninfections (3.70 infections per 100 person-years) in the placebo arm (non-significant\\n difference) (Gray 2011).\\nThe STEP trial raises important questions that can be answered only by further exam-\\nination of infected subjects and transmitted viruses. The fact that the increased infec-\\ntion risk was only seen in subjects with high antibody titers against the Ad5 vector\\nargues against a general risk of immunizing against HIV-1, but it demonstrates the\\nimportant issue of pre-existing vector immunity. The optimal priming of the immune\\nresponse by a vaccine seems to be a key element determining the success or failure\\nof a vaccine. More basic research is needed for a better understanding of the mech-\\nanisms of HIV-1 immunological control. Because of the unfavourable effects of pre-\\nexisting immunity against the adenovirus 5 vector, other adenoviral vectors are\\n currently developed from less frequent adenovirus serotypes. So far, two Phase 1\\nstudies in healthy volunteers have demonstrated the immunogenicity of new HIV-\\n1 vaccines based on the adenovirus serotypes AD26 (AD26.ENVA.01) and AD35\\n(AD35-GRIN/ENV) (Keefer MC 2010).    \\nIn contrast to the STEP trial, the RV144 study (Rerks-Ngarm 2009) involving more\\nthan 16,000 volunteers in Thailand showed a modest protective effect with a\\n significant reduction of new HIV-1 infections by about 31%. The vaccine was Sanofi\\nPasteur’s canarypox vector-based ALVAC HIV (vCP1521) expressing HIV-1 subtype B\\ngag and protease and subtype E envelope in combination with AIDSVAX B/E gp120\\nproteins (MN rgp120/HIV-1 plus A244 rgp120/HIV-1). Among the 8,198 subjects\\nreceiving placebo, 74 new HIV-1 infections were observed during the three years\\nfollow-up compared to 51 infections among the other half of volunteers that had\\nreceived four immunizations with the ALVAC HIV and two immunizations with\\nAIDSVAX B/E gp120 glycoproteins within a six month period. The vaccine had no\\neffect on viral set points and the clinical course of HIV-1 infection in the subjects\\ninfected (Rerks-Ngarm 2012). This was probably due to the fact that the vaccine\\ninduced only gp120-specific CD4 T cells (in 33% of the vaccinees), but almost no\\ngag-specific CD4 T cells (in 1% of vaccines) and no HIV-1-specific CD8 T cells\\n (measured by intracellular cytokine staining ICS). In contrast, almost every vaccinee\\ndeveloped high titer antibodies, although these antibodies only had a weak to mod-\\nerate capacity to neutralize various HIV-1 strains. The mechanisms of the protective\\neffect of the vaccine are still unresolved. It has been hypothesized that antibody-\\ndependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) may have played a role.

This study tested a prime-boost vaccination regimen. After three immuniza-\\ntions (week 0, 4, 8) with a DNA vaccine (6 plasmids: HIV-1 Clade B gag, pol, nef,\\nand env of clades A, B and C), the subjects were vaccinated at week 24 with a mixture\\nof four recombinant adenovirus 5 vectors (containing a gag-pol-fusion protein, and\\nthree env of clades A, B and C).

Acute HIV-1 Infection\\nHENDRIK STREECK AND MARCUS ALTFELD\\nIntroduction\\nWithin days of HIV-1 acquisition, a transient symptomatic illness associated with\\nhigh levels of HIV-1 replication and rapid loss of CD4 cells occurs. This highly\\ndynamic phase is accompanied by clinical symptoms similar to mononucleosis.\\nHowever, despite an estimate of 6,000 new HIV-1 transmissions per day (UNAIDS\\n2013 Global Report), the diagnosis is missed in the majority of cases. Most  commonly\\nother viral illnesses (i.e., flu) are often assumed to be the cause of the symptoms,\\nand there are no HIV-1-specific antibodies detectable at this early stage of infection.\\nThe diagnosis requires a high degree of awareness and clinical knowledge based on\\nclinical symptoms and history of exposure, in addition to specific laboratory tests\\n(detection of HIV-1 RNA or p24 antigen and negative HIV-1 antibodies).\\nAn accurate diagnosis of HIV-1 infection during this early stage of infection is par-\\nticularly important as about 50% of new sexual transmissions are estimated to happen\\nwhile a person is in this primary phase of infection (Brenner 2007). Indeed, phylo-\\ngenetic analyses demonstrate a clustering of infections during primary HIV-1 infec-\\ntion, and the catalytic effect of acute HIV-1 infection on the HIV pandemic could\\nbe prevented or at least slowed by early diagnosis and immediate antiretroviral\\ntherapy intervention (see below). The potentially beneficial use of antiretroviral\\ntherapy as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) could change the face of acute HIV-1\\ninfection in the future (see ART chapter). Recent studies conducted in South Africa,\\nEurope and the US have demonstrated that the use of tenofovir or tenofovir gel\\nmight significantly protect from HIV infection (Cohen 2011, Karim 2011). It has\\nbeen demonstrated that new HIV infections can be reduced by up to 86% (confi-\\ndence interval 40–99%) in individuals at high risk (IperGAY study, www.ipergay.fr).\\nWhile no resistant breakthroughs have been detected so far, it is currently unknown\\nhow much risk of increased viral resistance due to this monotherapeutic use of anti-\\nretroviral medication although it has not been seen to date except in people who\\nwere probably  serconverting near the time of starting PrEP. Moreover, it is unknown\\nwhether other antiretrovial medications or longer-acting formulations may be better\\nsuited as PrEP.\\nDefinition and classification\\nAcute HIV-1 infection (AHI) is defined by high levels of plasma HIV-1 RNA in the\\npresence of a negative anti-HIV-1 ELISA and/or negative/indeterminate Western Blot\\n(<3 bands positive) documenting the evolving humoral immune response; whereas\\nearly HIV-1 infection (EHI) includes anyone with documentation of being HIV-1\\nantibody negative in the preceding 6 months and is therefore broader than the\\n definition of acute HIV-1 infection. Both are included in the term primary HIV-1\\ninfection (PHI) (see Figure 1). A more detailed classification system of the early phases\\nof HIV infection is now in use (Fiebig 2003), which has little relevance for clinical\\ndecisions but is important for scientific purposes. The definition used influences the\\nmethods needed to make the diagnosis and any considerations regarding the path-\\nogenic implications of this stage of disease. Acute HIV-1 infection is often associated\\nwith an acute “retroviral syndrome” that usually includes fever with a variety of non-\\nspecific clinical and laboratory abnormalities. In contrast, subjects with early HIV-1\\ninfection can be asymptomatic. The time from exposure to symptomatic disease is\\n52'),\n",

Acute HIV-1\\ninfection is a very heterogeneous syndrome and individuals presenting with more\\nsevere symptoms during acute infection and a longer duration of the acute infec-\\ntion syndrome tend to progress more rapidly to AIDS (Vanhems 1998, Pedersen 1989,\\nKeet 1993). The clinical symptoms of acute HIV-1 infection were first described in\\n1985 as an illness resembling infectious mononucleosis (Cooper 1985). Several\\nnon-specific signs and symptoms have been reported in association with acute infec-\\ntion. Fever in the range of 38 to 40ºC is almost always present; in addition,\\n lymphadenopathy concomitant with the emergence of a specific immune response\\nto HIV occurs. A generalized rash is also common in symptomatic acute HIV infec-\\ntion. The eruption typically occurs 48 to 72 hours after the onset of fever and per-\\nsists for five to eight days. The upper thorax, collar region, and face are most affected\\nwith well-circumscribed, red colored macules or maculopapules. In addition, painful\\nmucocutaneous oral, vaginal, anal or penal ulcerations are one of the most distinc-\\ntive manifestations of the syndrome. \\nFurther common symptoms (see Table 1) are arthralgia, pharyngitis, malaise, weight\\nloss, aseptic meningitis and myalgia (Kahn 1998). Although none of these findings\\nare specific, several features, combinations of symptoms and prolonged duration are\\nsuggestive of HIV. The highest sensitivity for a clinical diagnosis of acute HIV-1 infec-\\ntion are fever (80%) and malaise (68%), whereas weight loss (86%) and oral ulcers\\n(85%) had the highest specificity (Hecht 2002). In this study, the symptoms of fever\\nand rash (especially in combination), followed by oral ulcers and pharyngitis had\\nthe highest positive predictive value for diagnosis of acute HIV-1 infection. In another\\nstudy, fever, rash, myalgia, arthralgia and night sweats were the best predictors of\\nacute infection (Daar 2001). \\nAcute HIV-1 Infection    53\\nFigure 1: Fiebig stages of acute HIV infection'),\n",

These are 2\\nnd generation lateral-flow rapid tests and therefore not effective\\nfor detecting acute HIV infections.\\n3\\nrd generation EIA tests can now detect IgM antibodies and therefore are able to detect\\na recent infection with HIV earlier than the 1st or 2nd generation tests (Hecht 2002).\\nThe recently developed 4 th generation EIA test now combines the detection of p24\\nantigen and p24 antibodies and therefore is able to detect HIV infection prior to\\nseroconversion (Ly 2007). However, although this test is able to detect HIV-1 infec-\\ntion much earlier than all previously developed tests, a second diagnostic false neg-\\native window can occur when equal levels of p24 antigen and anti-p24 antibody are\\npresent. The most substantiated diagnosis of acute HIV-1 infection is based on the\\ndetection of HIV-1 replication in the absence of HIV-1 antibodies (pre-seroconver-\\nsion). The most sensitive test is therefore based on detection of plasma HIV-1 RNA.\\nAll assays for HIV-1 RNA that have been compared (branched chain DNA, PCR and\\nGenProbe) have a sensitivity of 100%, but occasionally (in 2–5% of cases) can lead\\nto false positive results (Hecht 2002). False positive results from these tests are usually\\nbelow 2,000 copies HIV-1 RNA per ml, and therefore are far below the high titers of\\nviral load normally seen during acute HIV-1 infection (in our own studies subjects\\naverage 13 x 10\\n6 copies HIV-1 RNA/ml with a range of 0.25–95.5 x 10 6 copies HIV-1\\nRNA/ml). Repetition of the assay for HIV-1 RNA from the same sample with the same\\ntest led to a negative result in all false positive cases. Measurement of HIV-1 RNA\\nfrom duplicate samples therefore results in a sensitivity of 100% with 100%\\n specificity. In contrast, detection of p24 antigen has a sensitivity of only 79% with\\na specificity of 99.5–99.96%. The diagnosis of acute infection must be subsequently\\nconfirmed with a positive HIV-1 antibody test (seroconversion) within the follow-\\ning weeks. \\nDuring acute HIV-1 infection, there is frequently a marked decrease of the CD4 cell\\ncount, which later increases again, but usually does not normalize to initial levels.\\n54 The Basics'),\n",

Indeed, studies in rhesus macaques have demonstrated that the latent\\n cellular reservoir is already established on day 3 and predominantly found in central\\nmemory and stem cell like memory CD4 T cells (Whitney 2014). Simultaneously to\\nviral dissemination the destruction of CD4+ T lymphocytes, in particular within the\\nlymphoid tissues of the gut occurs. Early on in infection, the very high levels of HIV-\\n1 viremia are normally short-lived, indicating that the host is able to generate an\\nimmune response that can control viral replication. Over the following weeks,\\nviremia declines by several orders of magnitude before reaching a viral setpoint. This\\nsetpoint following resolution of the acute infection is a strong predictor of long-term\\ndisease progression rates (Mellors 1995 & 2007). It is therefore of critical importance\\nto characterize and understand the immune responses induced in the initial stages\\nof HIV-1 infection as these first responses appear responsible for the initial control\\nof viral replication.\\nIn contrast to hepatitis B and C infection, acute phase HIV replication is associated\\nwith the activation of a dramatic cytokine cascade, with plasma levels of some of the\\nmost rapidly induced innate cytokines peaking 7 days after the first detection of\\nplasma viremia and many other cytokines being upregulated as viral titers increase\\nto their peak. Although some of the cytokines/chemokines produced in acute HIV\\ninfection may contribute to the control of viral replication, the exaggerated cytokine\\nresponse likely also contributes to the early immunopathology of the infection and\\nassociated long-term consequences (Stacey 2009). Also, a specific activation and\\nexpansion of natural killer (NK) cells has been noted during the acute phase of\\n infection (Alter 2007). Indeed, it has been shown that NK cells can recognize and\\nkill HIV-infected cells (Alter 2011). \\nSeveral factors can influence viral replication during acute infection and the\\n establishment of a viral setpoint. These include the fitness of the infecting virus,\\nhost genetic factors and host immune responses. While it has been shown that the\\ntransmitted/founder virus population has intact principal gene open reading frames\\nand encodes replication-competent viruses (Salazar-Gonzalez 2009), the envelope\\n(env) gene of elite controllers has been demonstrated to mediate less efficient entry\\nthan the envelope protein of chronic progressors (Troyer 2009). Interestingly, acute\\ninfection envs exhibit an intermediate phenotypic pattern not distinctly different\\nfrom chronic progressor envs. These findings imply that lower env fitness may be\\nestablished early and may directly contribute to viral suppression in elite controllers.\\nAntibodies against HIV-1 with neutralizing capacities are rarely detectable during\\nprimary HIV-1 infection and are therefore less likely to be major contributors to the\\ninitial control of viral replication. However, broadly neutralizing antibodies develop\\nover time in a rare subset of HIV-infected individuals and the expression of specific\\nmarkers on CD4 T cells is modestly associated with the development of these\\nresponses (Mikell 2011). In addition, several studies have demonstrated a crucial role\\nof HIV-1-specific cellular immune responses for the initial control of viral replica-\\ntion. A massive, oligoclonal expansion of CD8 T cell responses has been described\\nduring acute HIV-1 infection (Pantaleo 1994), and the appearance of HIV-1-specific\\nCD8 T cells has been temporally associated with the initial decline of viremia (Koup\\n1994, Borrow 1994). These CD8 T cells have the ability to eliminate HIV-1-infected\\ncells directly by MHC class I-restricted cytolysis or indirectly by producing cytokines,\\nchemokines or other soluble factors, thus curtailing the generation of new viral\\nprogeny (Yang 1997). The biological relevance of HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T cells\\n(CTL) in acute HIV-1 infection was highlighted in in vivo studies demonstrating a\\ndramatic rise of SIV viremia and an accelerated clinical disease progression in\\nmacaques after the artificial depletion of CD8 T cells (Schmitz 1999, Jin 1999).\\nAdditional evidence for the antiviral pressure of HIV-1-specific CTLs during primary\\n56 The Basics'),\n",

A\\nstudy assessing the impact of early HIV-1-specific CD8 T cell responses on the early\\nviral set point in a cohort of over 420 subjects was able to demonstrate that the\\nability to mount a strong early CD8 T cell response during primary HIV-1 infection\\nis moderately associated with a lower viral setpoint (Streeck 2009). Furthermore, the\\nassessment of the CD8 T cell responses against autologous patient-virus-derived\\n peptides in three subjects suggest that even more, yet undetectable, responses are\\npresent during the acute phase of the infection contributing up to 15% each to the\\ninitial control of viral replication (Goonetilleke 2009). \\nMany of the early immunodominant CD8 T cell responses have been shown to be\\nrestricted by HLA class I alleles, which have been previously associated with slower\\ndisease progression such as HLA-B57 or -B27. Moreover, these HLA-restricted\\nresponses preferentially target epitopes within a short highly conserved region of\\np24/Gag (Streeck 2007). This region encodes the HIV-1 capsid, which has been shown\\nto be crucial for the stability of HIV-1 (Schneidewind 2007). The preservation of the\\nearly CD8 T cell responses has been associated with slower disease progression\\n(Streeck 2009), which might be linked by the presence of HIV-1-specific CD4 T helper\\nresponses during the CTL priming process. During acute infection, the number of\\nCD4 T cells decline, occasionally to levels that allow the development of oppor-\\ntunistic infections (Gupta 1993, Vento 1993). Even though the CD4 T cell count\\nrebounds with the resolution of primary infection, it rarely returns to baseline levels\\nin the absence of antiretroviral therapy. In addition to the decline in CD4 T cell\\ncounts, qualitative impairments of CD4 T cell function are perhaps the most char-\\nacteristic abnormalities detected in HIV-1 infection. The impairment of HIV-1-spe-\\ncific CD4 T cell function occurs very early in acute infection (Rosenberg 1997,\\nLichterfeld 2004), potentially due to the preferential infection of virus-specific CD4\\nT cells by HIV (Douek 2002). This is followed by a functional impairment of CD4 T\\ncell responses to other recall antigens, as well as a reduced responsiveness to novel\\nantigens (Lange 2003). The impairment of HIV-1-specific CD4 T helper cell function\\nin acute HIV-1 infection subsequently results in a functional impairment of HIV-1-\\nspecific CD8 T cells (Lichterfeld 2004). The antiviral contribution of CD4 T helper\\nresponse against HIV-1 not been well studied. A recent study demonstrated that a\\nspecific CD4 T cell subset with cytolytic properties expands during acute infection\\nonly in those patients that can subsequently control viral replication (Soghoian\\n2012). Moreover, both the protein specificity (Schieffer 2014) and granzyme A levels\\nin HIV-specific CD4 T cells can independently predict disease outcome. The  relevance\\nof this association is still under investigation.\\nHowever, CD4 T cells also contribute indirectly through the modulation of HIV-\\nspecific CD8 T cell responses (Chevalier 2011) or B cell responses to the control of\\nviral replication (Lindqvist 2012). It has been demonstrated in the lymphocytic\\n choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) mouse model that an efficacious CD8 T cell memory\\nresponse is dependent on the presence of a CD4 T cell response (Janssen 2003,\\nWilliams 2006). However, the CD4 T cell signals involved in this interaction are not\\nfully understood. Lack of CD4 T helper cells and chronic antigenic stimulation have\\nbeen described to be the major cause of the functional deficits CD8 T cells undergo\\nsoon after the early phase of infection. It has been demonstrated that IL21-secret-\\ning HIV-specific CD4 T cells can preserve and maintain the effector function of HIV-\\nspecific CD8 T cells and indeed these responses are mainly found in HIV elite\\n controllers (Chevalier 2011). \\nThe hierarchical loss of CD8 T cell function has been linked to the expression of\\ninhibitory molecules on the cell surface of HIV-1-specific CD8 T cells such as PD-1\\nAcute HIV-1 Infection    57'),\n",

The identification of such receptors\\nmight help in the generation of potential immune therapeutics to boost HIV-1-\\nspecific CD8 T cell function.\\nIn addition to host immune responses, host genetic factors play an important role\\nin both susceptibility and resistance to HIV-1 infection and speed of disease pro-\\ngression following infection (see Pathogenesis). The most important of these is a dele-\\ntion in the major co-receptor for entry of HIV-1 into CD4 T cells, a chemokine recep-\\ntor called CCR5 (Samson 1996). Homozygotes for this 32 base pair deletion\\n(CCR5delta32) do not express the receptor at the cell surface and can only be infected\\nwith HIV strains that are able to use other coreceptors such as CXCR4. Thus, although\\nCCR5delta32 homozygotic individuals show a significant degree of resistance to HIV-\\n1 infection (Samson 1996), a number of cases of infection with CXCR4-using HIV-\\n1 strains have been described (O’Brien 1997, Biti 1997). Heterozygotes for this dele-\\ntion exhibit significantly lower viral setpoints and slower progression to AIDS. In\\naddition to mutations in the chemokine receptor genes, a number of HLA class I\\nalleles, including HLA-B27 and -B57, have been described to be associated with both\\nlower viral setpoints and slower disease progression (O’Brien 2001, Kaslow 1996).\\nStudies demonstrate that individuals expressing HLA-B57 present significantly less\\nfrequently with symptomatic acute HIV-1 infection and exhibit a better control of\\nviral replication following acute infection (Altfeld 2003). A number of further poly-\\nmorphisms have been identified that have a potential impact on HIV-1 disease pro-\\ngression. Here especially, the axis between detrimental immune activation and ben-\\neficial immune responses is largely unknown and part of ongoing research. For\\nexample, it has been demonstrated that polymorphisms in the IL-10 promotor region\\ndirectly inhibit HIV replication, but may also promote viral persistence through the\\ninactivation of effector immune function (Naicker 2009). These data demonstrate\\nthat host genetic factors can influence the clinical manifestations of acute HIV-1\\ninfection and can have an important impact on the subsequent viral setpoint and\\nthe speed of disease progression. \\nTreatment\\nThe results of the START study in patients with chronic HIV infection clearly suggest\\nthat the initiation of antiretroviral therapy is beneficial for the patient and outweighs\\npotential risks due to long-term toxicity of the medication. In addition, antiretro-\\n viral therapy during acute HIV infection may also be beneficial for the immune\\nsystem of the patient and may lead to long-term control of viremia in the absence\\nof antiretroviral therapy. Several studies have suggested that treatment of acute HIV-\\n1 infection allows long-term viral suppression and might lead to a preservation and\\neven increase of HIV-1-specific CD4 helper cell responses.\\nPilot studies in patients who are treated during acute HIV-1 infection and subse-\\nquently start treatment interruptions show that the HIV-1-specific immune response\\ncan be boosted (Rosenberg 2000, Vogel 2006, Grijsen 2011), and that patients expe-\\nrience at least temporal control of viral replication. However, other studies were not\\nable to confirm this theoretic benefit (Markowitz 1999, Streeck 2006).

This strik-\\ning success of the VISCONTI cohort was not seen in a large randomized study\\n(SPARTAC 2013) in patients with primary HIV infection. While the authors overall\\nobserved a delay in disease progression, it was not significant when the time on ART\\nwas removed. \\nThus, while it is still unclear whether early initiation of ART has a substantial impact\\non disease outcome for the patient, studies suggest that early ART may reduce the\\noverall viral reservoir (Ananworanich 2013) and may lead to an overall reduction of\\nresidual viral replication on ART (Yerly 2000, Ngo-Giang-Huong 2001). In addition,\\nit has been speculated that the overall diversification of HIV is decreased (Delwart\\n2002) and that T, B and innate cell functions are preserved in treated individuals\\n(Oxenius 2000, Alter 2005, Moir 2010).

ART 2015/2016\\n6.1. Perspective\\nCHRISTIAN HOFFMANN\\nThe development of antiretroviral therapy has been one of the most dramatic\\n evolutions in the history of medicine. Few other areas have been subject to such fast\\nprogress, along with some short-lived trends. Those who have experienced the rapid\\ndevelopments of the last few years have been through quite a ride.\\nThe early years, from 1987–1990, brought great hope and the first modest advances\\nwith monotherapy (Volberding 1990, Fischl 1990). But when the results of the\\nConcorde Study arrived (Concorde 1994) both patients and clinicians plunged into\\na depression that lasted several years. AZT (zidovudine) was introduced as a treat-\\nment in March 1987 with great expectations. Although quickly approved after rapid\\nstudy, as monotherapy it was actually very limited. The same was true for the\\n nucleoside analogs ddC (zalcitabine), ddI (didanosine) and d4T (stavudine), all intro-\\nduced between 1991 and 1994. The lack of substantial treatment options led to a\\ndebate that lasted for several years about which nucleoside analog should be used,\\nwhen, and at what dose. A typical question was, “Should the alarm clock be set\\nduring the night for a sixth dose of AZT?”\\nPatients infected during the early and mid-80s were dying, and quickly. Hospices\\nwere established as well as support groups and ambulatory nursing services. One\\nbecame accustomed to AIDS and its resulting death toll. There was, however, defi-\\nnite progress in the field of opportunistic infections (OI) – cotrimoxazole, pentami-\\ndine, gancyclovir, foscarnet and fluconazole saved many patients’ lives, at least in\\nthe short-term. But the general picture was still tainted by an overall lack of hope.\\nMany remember the somber, still mood of the IX\\nth World AIDS Conference in Berlin\\nin June 1993. Between 1989 and 1994 not much improved. \\nThen in September 1995, the preliminary results of the European-Australian DELTA\\nStudy (Delta 1996) and the American ACTG 175 Study (Hammer 1996) attracted\\nattention. It became apparent that two nucleoside analogs were more effective than\\nmonotherapy. Indeed, the differences made in the clinical endpoints (AIDS and\\ndeath) were highly significant. Both studies demonstrated that it was of great impor-\\ntance to immediately start treatment with two nucleoside analogs, as opposed to\\nusing the drugs sequentially. \\nThis turned out to be the beginning of many breakthroughs. The first studies with\\nprotease inhibitors (PIs), a new class of drugs, had been under way for several months.\\nPIs had been designed in the lab using the knowledge of the molecular structure of\\nHIV and protease, but their clinical value remained uncertain. Preliminary data,\\nalong with many rumors, were circulating. Great impatience pervaded the patients\\nand clinician communities. By the fall of 1995, a fierce competition had started up\\nbetween three companies: Abbott, Roche and MSD. The licensing studies for the\\nthree PIs, ritonavir, saquinavir and indinavir, were pursued with intense effort. The\\nmonitors of these studies lived for weeks at the participating clinical sites. Deep into\\nthe night, case report files were written up and thousands of queries were answered.\\nThese efforts led to fast track approval for all three PIs between December 1995 and\\nMarch 1996 – first saquinavir, followed by ritonavir and indinavir – for the  treatment\\nof HIV. \\nMany clinicians (including this author) were not really aware of what was happen-\\ning during these months. AIDS remained ever-present. Although the incidence of\\nAIDS had dropped by half between 1992 and 1996, many were still dying. Doubts\\n64'),\n",

Hopes had already been raised too many times in the previous years by\\nsupposed miracles. Noone dared to proclaim a breakthrough. \\nIn February 1996, during the 3\\nrd Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic\\nInfections (CROI) in Washington, many caught their breath as Bill Cameron reported\\nthe first data from the ABT-247 study during the late breaker session. The  auditorium\\nwas absolutely silent. Riveted, listeners heard that the mere addition of ritonavir oral\\nsolution decreased the frequency of death and AIDS from 38% to 22% (Cameron\\n1998). These results were sensational in comparison to everything else that had been\\npreviously published.\\nThe World AIDS Conference in Vancouver a few months later in June 1996, where\\nthe great potential of PIs became fully apparent, developed into a celebration. Even\\nregular news channels reported in great depth on the new “AIDS cocktails”. The\\nstrangely unscientific expression “highly active antiretroviral therapy” (HAART)\\nbegan to spread irreversibly. \\nBy this time, David Ho, Time magazine’s “Man of the Year” in 1996, had shed light\\non the hitherto completely misunderstood kinetics of HIV with his breakthrough\\nresearch (Ho 1995, Perelson 1996). A year earlier, Ho had already initiated the slogan\\n“hit hard, hit early”, and almost all clinicians were now taking him at his word. With\\nthe new knowledge of the incredibly high turnover of the virus and the relentless\\ndaily destruction of CD4 T cells, there was no longer any consideration of a latent\\nphase – and no life without antiretroviral therapy. In many centers almost every\\npatient was treated with ART. Within only three years, 1994-1997, the proportion\\nof untreated patients in Europe decreased from 37% to barely 9%, whilst the pro-\\nportion of patients on ART rose from 2% to 64% (Kirk 1998). \\nThings were looking good. By June 1996, a third drug class was introduced when\\nthe first non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, nevirapine, was licensed. One\\nnow had a great selection of medications at hand. Most patients seemed to tolerate\\nthe drugs. 20 or 30 pills a day? Not much of a problem, if it helped. And how it\\nhelped! The number of AIDS cases was drastically reduced. Within only four years,\\nbetween 1994 and 1998, the incidence of AIDS in Europe was reduced from 30.7 to\\n2.5 per 100 patient years – i.e., to less than one tenth of what it was. Some of the\\nmost feared opportunistic infections now occurred only rarely (Mocroft 2000). HIV-\\nspecialized ophthalmologists began looking for new areas of work. The large OI trials,\\nplanned only a few months before, faltered due to a lack of patients. Hospices, which\\nhad been receiving substantial donations, shut down or changed their focus. The\\nfirst patients began to leave the hospices and went back to work; ambulatory nursing\\nservices shut down. Patients with other diseases occupied AIDS wards. \\nHowever, in early 1997, some patients began to complain of an increasingly fat\\nstomach, but was this not a good sign after years of wasting and supplementary\\nnutrition? The lower viremia was thought to use up far less energy. It was assumed\\nthat, because patients were less depressed and generally healthier, they would eat\\nmore. At most, it was slightly disturbing that the patients retained thin faces.\\nHowever, more and more patients also began to complain about the high pill burden.\\nIn June 1997, the FDA published the first warning about the development of  diabetes\\nmellitus associated with the use of PIs. In February 1998, CROI in Chicago finally\\nbrought home the realization among clinicians that PIs were perhaps not as  selective\\nas had long been believed. One poster after another, indeed whole walls of pictures,\\nshowed fat abdomens, buffalo humps, thin legs and faces. Lipodystrophy has become\\nan ubiquitous term in HIV medicine today. However, our understanding of the\\nreasons and mechanisms behind this phenomenon remains incomplete. Fortunately,\\n lipodystrophy prevalence has decreased, with the introduction of new  antiretroviral\\ndrug classes. \\n6.1. Perspective    65'),\n",

Mathematical models were evidently not real life. In 1997, it was\\nestimated that viral suppression with a maximum duration of three years was nec-\\nessary; it was predicted that all infected cells would die in this time. Since then, the\\nduration has constantly been adjusted upwards. Estimates evolved upwards to around\\n60 to 70 years (Silicano 2003). These numbers show one thing: HIV will not be cured\\nwith standard ART. More recent studies have come to the sobering conclusion that\\nHIV remains detectable in latent infected cells, even after long-term suppression.\\nAnd Timothy Brown, the only person up to now who has been cured from HIV infec-\\ntion (by an allogenous stem cell transplantation that transferred a rare genetic vari-\\nation to his immune system) remains a singular case. \\nIn fact, today’s reality seemed impossible ten years ago: HIV infection is a chronic\\ndisease which, although incurable, is manageable lifelong with therapy, even in\\npatients with resistant virus. CCR5 antagonists as well as integrase inhibitors have\\nopened up new possibilities of treatment. It has become increasingly possible to\\nlower viral loads to below detection in most patients. The pioneer drugs maraviroc\\nand raltegravir have been shown to be extremely well-tolerated. These new drug\\nclasses will bring about fundamental changes to current ART. The dogma of always\\nusing two nucleoside analogs as the backbone of every therapy may start to change.\\nMany of the currently widespread drugs will disappear over the next few years. The\\nend of HIVID\\n®, Agenerase®, Fortovase® or Viracept® is just the beginning. Veteran\\nagents like AZT, d4T, ddI, nelfinavir or indinavir are not recommended by guidelines\\nanymore although they served us in HIV management in the nineties. Will we be\\nneeding saquinavir, fosampranavir or even efavirenz and lopinavir as much as we\\ndo today five years from now?\\nA normal life expectancy seems realistic today with treatment. Therapy is likely to\\nbe permanent. This will pose a tremendous challenge for patients, physicians and\\nfor the pharmaceutical industry and payors. The comfortable situation at present\\ndoes not mean one can relax. New drugs are urgently needed. There is uncertainty\\nabout whether our drugs can stand the test of time over decades. Effects on the heart,\\nkidney, bones and other organs in an aging HIV population are difficult to foresee.\\nIf the cure is delayed, over the decades one will need a wider breadth and range of\\navailable drugs. It will not be easy for new drugs to be approved, as vicriviroc has\\nshown. How do you show the advantages of a new drug over other successful ther-\\napies today? Approval for new drugs is becoming more strict and the market is tight-\\nening. Already one can observe the pharmaceutical industry’s caution. The days may\\nbe over when an HIV drug got from the laboratory to the market within five years.\\nCompared to the previous decade, the HIV ARV pipeline is now drying up. New\\nstrategies are needed.  \\nAt the same time, the simple question of “when to start” with ART has remained\\nunanswered for a long time. Instead of David Ho’s recommendation from the nineties\\n“hit hard, hit early”, we often heared “hit HIV hard, but only when necessary”\\n(Harrington 2000) during the last decade. With the START study results appearing\\nat the horizon, there is no doubt that this will change again. The pendulum will\\nswing back. But do really all patients need a therapy? At any CD4 T cell count? What\\nroles do the following play: viral load, CD4 T cell changes, CD4 percentages, age,\\ngender, host elements and viral tropism? What about acutely infected patients? These\\nstrategically important questions will hopefully find some answers through detailed\\nanalysis of the START study that are underway now. Until then, this issue requires\\nkeen sensitivity.\\nHIV clinicians are well-advised to keep an open mind to new approaches.

Sometimes a pharmaceutical\\ncompany does not hold authorization for production worldwide. The NNRTI\\nefavirenz, for example, is produced by BMS in Germany under the brand name\\nSustiva\\n® and in Austria by MSD under the name of Stocrin ®. Several agents such as\\nAZT, 3TC, AZT+3TC but also efavirenz, nevirapine or saquinavir are available as\\n generics. The situation will not improve when patents and rights for many agents,\\nincluding blockbuster drugs such as tenofovir or darunavir will run out in the near\\nfuture. \\nMoreover, definitions for indication areas vary widely. Some agents are specifically\\nnot licensed for primary (first line) therapy, such as entry inhibitors, the PI tipranavir\\nand the NNRTI etravirine, as well as combination agents such as Atripla\\n® in Europe.\\nOther limits: The NNRTI rilpivirine is restricted to patients with a plasma viremia of\\nless than 100,000 HIV RNA copies/ml. Before initiation of abacavir, HLA pretesting\\nis necessary and the use of maraviroc requires a valid tropism test. Several drugs\\nshould be used in pregnant women and children. Complex dosing instructions have\\nto be considered for some drugs, due to drug-drug interactions or due to to renal or\\nhepatic insufficiency. More details can also be found in the chapter “Drugs” at the\\nend of this book.\\nIn the face of cost pressures suffered by health systems, it is advisable for clinicians\\nto adhere to the specific indication areas of the individual agents. Due to such a wide\\nrange of choices, this is possible in most cases, although not in all. Clinicians should\\nhave good reason when using an agent outside the stated indication area. A thor-\\nough documentation should be kept in case of disagreement from payors.\\nCosts\\nAntiretroviral treatment is expensive. A health provider needs to be aware of drug\\ncosts. Even within drug classes, there are astonishing differences. For example, the\\nPI indinavir (Crixivan\\n®, hardly used today) is relatively cheap in most countries,\\nwhile the PI tipranavir (Aptivus ®) is more than three times the price. Even in\\n recommended first-line therapies in guidelines there are great price variations: PIs\\nare almost double the price of NNRTIs in many countries. A salvage therapy for a\\npatient with multiresistant virus can amount to as much as € 30,000–50,000 and\\nmore per year. For pricing in low- or middle-income countries, please refer to the\\nchapter Global Access to HIV Treatment.\\nIt is difficult to comprehend the pricing policies of pharmaceutical companies. The\\nreason why prices for directly competing agents (3TC and FTC) are almost exactly\\nthe same, whilst prices for other agents of the same drug class differ by 200–300%,\\ncannot be explained by development costs alone. There is no doubt that ART is a\\nmoney-maker and the market is full of competitors – monopolies and patents are\\nbeing protected. Despite all the criticism and price discussions, two facts cannot be\\nforgotten: \\nFirst, the high development costs for new medicines can rise to a billion dollars or\\nmore. Most agents never make it to the market. Even a licensed drug such as T-20\\nmay never recoup its development costs. According to Roche, research and\\n development alone chewed up 600 million dollars. To cover such production costs,\\nthousands of patients worldwide would have to be treated with T-20 for several years\\n– a very unrealistic scenario.\\n70 ART'),\n",

US\\n estimations assume an expenditure of between $13,000 and $23,000 per additional\\nQALY (quality-adjusted life year) (Freedberg 2001). Compared to many other thera-\\npies this is relatively cheap. ART reduces the cost of expensive treatment of oppor-\\ntunistic infections, inpatient and outpatient care. In one German study, between\\n1997 and 2001 total annual spending per patient decreased from € 35,865 to € 24,482\\n(Stoll 2002). Many patients return to work, resulting in an overall economic gain for\\nsociety (Sendi 1999). \\nNevertheless, ART is expensive. Therefore, it should be expected from patients to use\\nup remaining packets of drugs, etc. if the reasons for a change in therapy are not\\nurgent. Concerns of pill reduction or doubts about long-term toxicity should be part\\nof an ongoing discussion with patients. All patients need to be made aware of the\\ncosts of medication so they can better understand the value of the therapy.\\nInitially, ART should be prescribed for a month. This way, mountains of unused pills\\nwill not be wasted if signs of intolerability or complicated adverse events occur. If\\nresponse to ART is positive and its effects constant, prescriptions can then be done\\nfor a maximum period of three months. Many companies now offer three-month\\nsupply packages. \\nNucleoside Analogs (NRTIs)\\nMechanism of action\\nNucleoside analogs (“nukes”) are also referred to as nucleoside reverse transcriptase\\ninhibitors (NRTIs). Their target is the HIV enzyme reverse transcriptase. Acting as\\nalternative substrates, they compete with physiological nucleosides, differing from\\nthem only by a minor modification in the ribose molecule. The incorporation of\\nnucleoside analogs induces the abortion of DNA synthesis because phosphodiester\\nbridges can no longer be built to stabilize the double strand. Nucleoside analogs are\\npro-drugs. They are converted to the active metabolite only after endocytosis,\\nwhereby they are phosphorylated to the effective triphosphate derivatives. \\nNucleoside analogs were the first antiretroviral agents on the market. AZT (zidovu-\\ndine, Retrovir\\n®) was approved for the treatment of HIV infection in 1987. Once-daily\\ndosing is sufficient for many nukes. Overall tolerability is fairly good. However,\\n frequent complaints during the first weeks are fatigue, headache and (mostly mild)\\ngastrointestinal problems. The gastrointestinal complaints can be treated sympto-\\nmatically (see chapter on Management of Side Effects).\\nNucleoside analogs can cause a wide variety of long-term side effects, including\\nmyelotoxicity, lactate acidosis, polyneuropathy and pancreatitis. Many metabolic\\ndisorders, especially lipoatrophy, are also attributed to nucleoside analogs (Galli 2002,\\nMallal 2002). Long-term side effects that are possibly related to mitochondrial\\n toxicity were first described in 1999 (Brinkmann 1999). Mitochondrial function\\nrequires nucleosides. The metabolism of these important organelles is disrupted by\\nthe incorporation of false nucleosides (the drugs) leading to mitochondrial\\n degeneration. Clinical and scientific data indicate that there are considerable dif-\\nferences between individual drugs with regard to mitochondrial toxicity. Agents like\\nd4T or ddI are more toxic than abacavir or 3TC and are therefore no longer used in\\nHIV treatment today. Ddc has disappeared entirely. \\nHowever, it is also possible that beside mitochondrial damage other mechanisms\\ncontribute to toxicity. Recently it was shown that NRTIs (specifically tenofovir) but\\nnot NNRTIs can inhibit telomerase activity. Telomerase is a specialized reverse\\n transcriptase responsible for the de novo synthesis of telomeric DNA repeats. Its\\n inhibition by NRTIs may lead to accelerated shortening of telomere length in\\n6.2. Overview of antiretroviral agents    71'),\n",

A telomere is a region at each end of a chromatid, which protects\\nthe end of the chromosome from deterioration or from fusion with neighbouring\\nchromosomes. Over time, due to each cell division, the telomere ends become slightly\\nshorter. By inhibition of telomerase activity, NRTIs may thus contribute to acceler-\\nated aging in HIV+ patients (Hukezali 2012, Leeansyah 2013).\\nNucleoside analogs are eliminated mainly by renal excretion and do not interact\\nwith drugs that are metabolized by hepatic enzymes. There is therefore little  potential\\nfor interaction. However, ribavirin, used in the treatment of hepatitis C, can reduce\\nintracellular phosphorylation of AZT or d4T (Piscitelli 2001). In patients with renal\\nfailure, the dosage of nucleoside analogs has to be adjusted. AZT and d4T are\\n thymidine analogs, while FTC and 3TC are cytidine analogs. Combinations\\n containing AZT plus d4T or FTC plus 3TC are pointless since these drugs compete\\nfor the same attachment pocket. There is a high degree of cross-resistance between\\nNRTIs (see chapter on Resistance).\\nIndividual agents\\nAbacavir (ABC, Ziagen®) is a guanosine analog. Monotherapy studies showed this\\ndrug to lower viral load by approximately 1.4 logs within 4 weeks, but that  resistance\\ndevelops rapidly (Harrigan 2000). Abacavir is phosphorylated intracellularly to  carbovir\\ntriphosphate, which has a long half-life (Harris 2002). In 2004,  following larger\\nstudies, abacavir was licensed for once-daily therapy (Moyle 2005, Sosa 2005). \\nABC+3TC is comparable in efficacy to AZT+3TC (DeJesus 2004). In combination with\\nAZT+3TC (Trizivir\\n®, see section on Triple Nukes), abacavir was less effective than\\nefavirenz (Gulick 2004) or indinavir (Staszewski 2001). In randomized studies, a\\nswitch from a successful PI- or NNRTI-containing therapy to abacavir plus two NRTIs\\nproved relatively safe (Clumeck 2001, Katlama 2003, Martinez 2003, Bonjoch 2005).\\nHowever, there is an increased risk of virological failure, especially in extensively\\npretreated patients (Opravil 2002, Martinez 2003, Bommenell 2011). In particular,\\nwith the combination ABC+TDF+3TC, resistance can develop rapidly (see section on\\nTriple Nukes).\\nWith respect to mitochondrial toxicity, abacavir seems to compare favorably to other\\nNRTIs. In comparison with d4T, the risk of lipoatrophy is lower (Podzamczer 2006).\\nMoreover, switching from d4T to abacavir led to improvements in subjects with\\n existing lipodystrophy (Carr 2002, John 2003, Moyle 2003, McComsey 2005).\\nImprovement was associated with an increase in mitochondrial DNA as shown in in\\nvitro studies (Hoy 2004, Martin 2004, McComsey 2005).\\nOne drawback to the use of abacavir is the risk of hypersensitivity reaction (HSR).\\nHSR occurs in 4-6% of patients. On re-exposure after stopping ABC due to HSR, it\\ncan be fatal. Cases of severe HSR have been reported after only a single abacavir dose\\n(De la Rosa 2004) or after treatment re-initiation despite prior tolerability (El-Sahly\\n2004). A genetic predisposition exists. 80% of cases of HSR occurs in patients with\\nthe HLA B*5701 allele (Mallal 2002, Hetherington 2002). The predictive value of the\\nHLA test was proven in the large PREDICT trial (Mallal 2008), and the assay is now\\nobligatory prior to starting abacavir. However, clinical HSR cases without the HLA\\nB*5701 allele have been observed on very rare occasions. \\nOnce the problem with HSR was largely resolved, abacavir came under pressure again\\nin 2008. Cohort studies reported an association between recent use of abacavir and\\nan increased risk of myocardial infarction (Sabin 2008, SMART 2008). Although this\\nwas not confirmed by two recent meta-analyses (Cruciani 2011, Ribaudo 2011), some\\nexperts still believe that alternative regimens should be considered for patients with\\nunderlying high cardiovascular disease risk (Behrens 2010, Sabin 2014). \\n72 ART'),\n",

The earliest studies that tested AZT monotherapy were able to show a\\n significant survival benefit – in very immunocompromised patients (Fischl 1987).\\nIn  contrast, two other very large early studies, ACTG 016 and ACTG 019, were not\\nable to demonstrate significant survival benefit in asymptomatic patients, although\\nthe risk for progression was significantly reduced in both (Fischl 1990, Volberding\\n1990). Even at that time, it was becoming apparent that the success of AZT monother-\\napy was likely to be limited. The Concorde Study brought AZT into disrepute by\\nshowing that there was no long-term benefit of AZT treatment. The higher doses\\n(1500 mg/day) led to considerable myelotoxicity (Fischl 1990). Myelotoxicity should\\nalso not be underestimated with the current dosages of 500–600 mg/day; monitor-\\ning of the blood is obligatory. Long-term treatment almost always increases the mean\\n corpuscular volume of erythrocytes, which is to some extent a measure of monitor-\\ning adherence. AZT is very effective in combination with other ARV drugs. In the\\nnineties, the combination of AZT and 3TC was one of the most frequently used\\n backbones in HIV therapy. AZT has been tested in numerous clinical studies and\\noffers more experience than any other agent (over 20 years).  \\nAZT came under heightened scrutiny when it performed worse than tenofovir in the\\nGilead 934 study. In this large-scale randomized study, ART-naïve patients were\\ntreated with efavirenz plus either AZT+3TC or TDF+FTC. In particular, severe anemia\\nwas more frequent on AZT, leading to withdrawal in 5.5% (Gallant 2006). After 144\\nweeks, fewer patients on AZT had a viral load of less then 400 copies/ml than on\\nTDF (58% vs 71%). This difference was due in large part to the fact that more patients\\non AZT withdrew due to adverse events (11% vs 5%). Apart from myelotoxicity\\nincluding anemia and neutropenia, side effects leading to discontinuation were\\nmainly gastrointestinal complaints such as nausea, usually occurring within the first\\nfew weeks of treatment. Moreover, a significant reduction in fat tissue of the extrem-\\nities while on AZT was observed (Arribas 2008). Many studies have confirmed an\\nimprovement of lipoatrophy after switching from AZT to other drugs (see below). \\nConsequently, in many guidelines AZT is no longer recommended. Another\\n disadvantage is that AZT needs to be taken twice daily, thereby disqualifying it as\\nbeing part of once-daily combinations. Thus, AZT currently remains a component\\nof some salvage regimens that are used for  resistant viruses. For example, a hyper-\\nsensitivity to AZT is seen in viral isolates with mutations K65R or M184V. The good\\nCNS penetration of AZT can be used in the setting of HIV-associated neurocognitive\\ndisorders (HAND, see there).\\nddC (zalcitabine, HIVID\\n®) was the third NRTI to reach the market in 1992. Limited\\nefficacy, unfavorable pharmacokinetics and side effects led to its withdrawal from\\nthe market in June 2006 – a first in HIV therapy.\\nddI (didanosine, Videx\\n®) was, in 1991, the second NRTI to be licensed. Antiretroviral\\nefficacy is comparable to AZT (Berenguer 2008). However, ddI is currently used only\\nin very limited situations (Molina 2005) due to toxicity. Gastrointestinal complaints\\nand polyneuropathy are the main side effects. Pancreatitis occurs in up to 10%, and\\ncan be fatal. This toxicity is probably dose-dependent. The cause for this is unclear,\\nbut could possibly be related to disorders of purine metabolism (Moyle 2004). Special\\ncaution should be given to combinations with ribavirin, d4T, hydroxyurea or teno-\\nfovir (Havlir 2001, Martinez 2004). The dosage needs to be adjusted according to the\\npatient’s weight. If body weight is less than 60 kg, the dose should be reduced from\\n400 mg to 250 mg. Of note, ddI has to always be taken on an empty stomach. \\n6.2. Overview of antiretroviral agents    73'),\n",

Although better tolerated (less gastrointestinal complaints) and just as effective\\nas AZT, d4T is hardly ever used nowadays in western industrialized countries. This\\nis mainly due to its long-term toxicities in comparison to other NRTIs, shown in\\nlarge randomized studies (Gallant 2004, Saag 2004). Use of d4T is associated with\\nlactic acidosis and Guillain-Barré-like syndromes (Mokrzycki 2000, Shah 2003), as\\nwell as for lipoatrophy (Mallal 2000, Mauss 2002). Numerous studies have now been\\npublished in which substitution of d4T by other NRTIs, particularly abacavir or\\n tenofovir, had positive effects on lipoatrophy and other metabolic disorders (see\\nchapter 6.7). In March 2011, a warning letter was distributed to physicians accord-\\ning that clarified that d4T is indicated only if there are no other options. Duration\\nis limited to the shortest possible time and whenever possible patients should switch\\nto alternatives. There is nothing else to be said. \\n3TC (lamivudine, Epivir\\n®) was licensed in Europe in August 1996 as the fifth NRTI.\\nIt is a well-tolerated cytidine analog and part of various fixed-dose combinations,\\namong them Combivir\\n®, Kivexa® (US: Epzicom®) or Triumeq®. Its main disadvantage\\nis its rapid development of resistance, and a single point mutation (M184V) is\\n sufficient for compromising its effectiveness. Resistance is likely to develop after only\\na few weeks (Eron 1995). The full effect of 3TC only emerges in combination with\\nother nucleoside analogs. Large studies such as NUCB 3002 or CAESAR showed a\\n significant clinical benefit when 3TC was added to nucleoside therapy (Staszewski\\n1997). The M184V point mutation does have advantages: not only does it improve\\nthe susceptibility of certain AZT-resistant viruses in some patients but it also impairs\\nviral fitness (Miller 2002). This was demonstrated in a study with monotherapy in\\npatients with the M184V mutation: maintaining 3TC monotherapy was associated\\nwith a lower increase in viral load and slower CD4 T cell decline compared to\\n completely stopping ART (see chapter 6.9). Keeping 3TC as part of a combination\\ndespite proven resistance is therefore sensible in order to conserve the M184V muta-\\ntion and thus reduce the replicative capacity of HIV , especially when not all the other\\nagents in the regimen are active. The antiviral efficacy of 3TC is the same as that for\\nFTC (Rousseau 2003, Benson 2004). Once-daily dosing is possible although the half-\\nlife of 3TC is less than that of FTC (DeJesus 2004). 3TC has also efficacy against hep-\\natitis B viruses. However, resistance mutations may occur rapidly. In HBV coinfected\\npatients, 3TC should be combined with other HBV drugs.\\nFTC (emtricitabine, Emtriva\\n®) is a cytidine analog. It is biochemically very similar\\nto 3TC, but has a longer half-life. Once-daily dosing is possible, and the drug also\\nhas efficacy against HBV. Tolerability is good, while the potential for interactions is\\nminimal (Frampton 2005). FTC seems to have a low affinity for the mitochondrial\\npolymerase so the risk of mitochondrial toxicity is likely to be relatively low. FTC\\nwas as effective as 3TC both as monotherapy as well as in combination with AZT\\n(Rousseau 2003, Benson 2004). However, as with 3TC, efficacy is limited by the\\nM184V point mutation. The drug was licensed in 2003 when a randomized, double-\\nblinded trial (FTC-301) showed that FTC was more effective and tolerable than d4T\\n(Saag 2004). The combination of TDF+FTC was superior to AZT+3TC in the large \\nGS-934 study, notably in terms of tolerability (Gallant 2006, Arribas 2008).\\nTolerability was probably in most part due to the second agent (AZT or d4T) and not\\nFTC or 3TC. FTC is currently an important component in combination therapy as\\na fixed partner of tenofovir (Truvada\\n®). The combination of FTC and tenofovir is\\nfound in three STRs, namely (Atripla®, Complera® and Stribild®). Like with 3TC, the\\nindividual agent (Emtriva ®) does not play a role. Due to the fact that no clinical\\n differences have yet been established between 3TC and FTC, the choice between the\\ntwo is usually determined by its co-medication (abacavir, tenofovir, AZT). \\n74 ART'),\n",

As a result of this convincing clinical data, the drug is still among\\nthe most widely used agents in antiretroviral therapies. In the 934 study, TDF+FTC\\nwere significantly better than AZT+3TC (Gallant 2006, Arribas 2008), particularly\\ndue to improved tolerability. Furthermore, tenofovir can help improve lipoatrophy\\nand dyslipidemia (see chapter 6.7). Another advantage is its efficacy against the\\n hepatitis B virus, which resulted in the licensing of this drug for HBV monoinfection.\\nOther areas of use are in vertical prevention and pre-exposure prophylaxis (see\\n appropriate chapters). \\nSome problems have come to light with the more extensive use of TDF. The combi-\\nnation with ddI should be avoided. An unfavorable interaction with atazanavir exists\\nthat calls for being boosted with ritonavir (Taburet 2004). Efficacy may also be limited\\nin some triple nuke regimens (see section on Triple Nukes). \\nHowever, the main problem today with tenofovir is its potential risk of nephrotoxicity\\n(see chapter on HIV and Renal Function). Nephrotoxicity is reflected by a mostly mild\\ndisturbance of renal function (Review: Hall 2011). Fortunately, severe dysfunctions\\nare very rare (Gallant 2008, Scherzer 2012). In a Swiss cohort trial, 46 out of 2,592\\npatients (1.6%) had to discontinue tenofovir due to renal toxicity, on average within\\n442 days (Fux 2007). The risk of renal toxicity seems to be higher when tenofovir is\\ncombined with boosted PIs (Young 2012). Renal failure can also be observed in the\\nsetting of Fanconi syndrome, a defect of the proximal tubular transport (Schaaf 2003,\\nHall 2011). Patients with renal disease should either not be treated with tenofovir,\\nor receive a lower dose (see chapter on Drugs). Elderly patients and patients with low\\nbody weight are particularly at risk (Crane 2006). However, it is so far impossible to\\npredict who is at risk of developing renal dysfunction. According to current data,\\nbecause it is taken by such a large number of patients, it is important to remain alert\\nand to regularly check renal function of patients on tenofovir, especially of those on\\nlong-term therapy. Tenofovir is also associated with bone damage such as osteomalacia.\\nThere is no doubt, that during the next years, many patients will replace TDF by\\ntenofovir alafenamide (TAF, see also next chapter). TAF is a novel prodrug of teno-\\nfovir which has a different structure to TDF, reaching adequate tenofovir concen-\\ntrations in cells at a much lower dose, which has less potential to harm kidney and\\nbone tissue. Gilead has applied for approval (or plans to do so) of different TAF-inclu-\\nsive versions of Truvada\\n®, Complera® and Stribild®.\\nThe choice of nuke backbones\\nUntil now, all classical ART regimens have contained two nucleoside or nucleotide\\nanalogs (the “nuke backbone”). This is mainly historical: nucleoside analogs were\\nthe first HIV drugs, and when PIs appeared years later, treatment with two nukes\\nwas standard.

In\\nthe Gilead 903 Study, the combination TDF+3TC was not only as virologically\\n effective as d4T+3TC, but was also much better tolerated (Gallant 2004). Since the\\nintroduction of FTC and the fixed-dose combination tablets of Truvada\\n®, Atripla®,\\nand, more recently, Complera® and Stribild®, tenofovir is almost always co-admin-\\nistered with FTC, and TDF+FTC is the most frequently-used NRTI backbone. In the\\nGilead 934 Study (Gallant 2006), enrolling 509 ART-naïve patients, TDF+FTC was\\ntested against AZT+3TC in an open-label design (all patients also received efavirenz).\\nAt 48 weeks, a larger proportion of patients in the TDF+FTC arm reached less than\\n50 copies/ml (80% versus 70%). This was even true for patients with a higher base-\\nline viral load. The significant differences were primarily related to the poorer tol-\\nerability of Combivir\\n®, which often resulted in the discontinuation of therapy (9%\\nversus 4%). Virological failure and resistance mutations were approximately equal\\nin both arms and were infrequent. After 144 weeks, lipoatrophy was less frequent in\\nthe TDF+FTC arm (Arribas 2008). In the near future, tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), a\\nnovel prodrug of tenofovir, will probably replace TDF in many patients. There is no\\ndoubt that TDF+FTC or TAF+FTC will remain the most frequently used backbone\\nduring the coming years.\\nABC+3TC\\nAnother frequent backbone is ABC+3TC, which is also available in a fixed-dose\\n combination known either as Kivexa\\n® or Epzicom®. The double-blind randomized\\nCNA30024 Study showed the non-inferiority of ABC+3TC in comparison to\\nCombivir\\n® (DeJesus 2004). In the ABCDE Study, ABC+3TC had the same efficacy as\\nd4T+3TC, but had less toxicity (Podzamczer 2006). \\nOver the last few years, ABC+3TC has been compared to TDF+FTC in several ran-\\ndomized studies of therapy-naïve patients (ASSERT, ACTG 5202, HEAT), as well as\\nin treatment-experienced patients (BICOMBO, STEAL), see also the following Table.\\n76 ART'),\n",

ABC+3TC were equivalent to TDF+FTC in\\nHEAT and STEAL. In contrast, ACTG 5202, ASSERT and BICOMBO showed some\\n differences to the disadvantage of ABC+3TC.

However, in studies like BICOMBO and\\nACTG 5202, HLA testing was not performed, which significantly reduces abacavir\\nHSR and which is now routine testing. It must be stressed that overall, results of\\nTDF+FTC and ABC+3TC do not vary greatly despite the very different settings. This\\napplies also to the risk of lipoatrophy. At least two studies did not see significant\\n differences between these two backbones (Curran 2011, McComsey 2011). In some\\nrandomized studies, lipid changes improved after switch from ABC+3TC to TDF+FTC\\n(Behrens 2012, Campo 2013, Moyle 2015).

There is more experience with this combination than\\nwith any other. The resistance profile is favorable: the M184V mutation that\\n frequently develops during 3TC treatment increases sensitivity to AZT. AZT+3TC are\\nusually given as Combivir\\n®. Although the licensing study for Combivir® showed no\\ndifference in toxicity (Eron 2000), in our experience the 300 mg AZT dose in\\nCombivir\\n® is too high for some patients and can lead to anemia. In such cases, it is\\nworth trying AZT+3TC as individual components, so that the dose of AZT can be\\nreduced to 250 mg BID.\\nAZT+3TC has comparable efficacy to d4T+3TC or to AZT+FTC (Benson 2004). The\\nACTG 384 Study showed superiority of AZT+3TC over d4T+ddI (Robbins 2003, Shafer\\n2003). However, this notion did change over time: while early results suggested a\\nlower rate of lipoatrophy (Molina 1999), the development of lipoatrophy with\\nAZT+3TC occurred only slightly later than with d4T+ddI. AZT+3TC was shown to\\nbe less effective and less well-tolerated than TDF+FTC in the GS-934 study (Gallant\\n2006, Pozniak 2006). Another large ACTG study also showed that it was less well-\\n6.2.

As with the nucleoside analogs, the target\\nenzyme is reverse transcriptase. However, NNRTIs bind directly and non-competi-\\ntively to the enzyme at a position near to but distinct from the substrate binding\\nsite for nucleosides. The resulting complex blocks the catalyst-activated binding site\\nof the reverse transcriptase. This in turn can bind fewer nucleosides, slowing down\\npolymerization significantly. In contrast to NRTIs, NNRTIs do not require activation\\nwithin the cell. \\nThree first-generation NNRTIs – nevirapine, delavirdine and efavirenz – were intro-\\nduced between 1996 and 1998. Although studies such as ACTG 241 or INCAS had\\nalready clearly demonstrated the superiority of triple therapy compared to double\\nnukes (D’Aquila 1996, Raboud 1999, Conway 2000), the acceptance and use of\\nNNRTIs was rather slow and did not receive the media attention given to the PIs. \\nThis was due to the early observation that functional monotherapy with NNRTIs,\\ni.e., the addition of an NNRTI to a failing NRTI regimen, showed practically no effect.\\nThere were also initial difficulties in dealing with the development of resistance: the\\nrisk of resistance is not only very high, but it can develop very rapidly. Once it occurs,\\nit almost always indicates cross-resistance to other NNRTIs (Cozzi-Lepri 2012).\\nResistance has even been described in mothers who took a single dose of nevirap-\\nine as transmission prophylaxis. In large studies, the frequency of NNRTI mutations\\nfollowing a single perinatal nevirapine dose was between 14% and a worrying 65%\\n(Cunningham 2002, Jourdain 2004, Johnson 2005), which can impair the success of\\nlater NNRTI therapies (Lockman 2010, Boltz 2012). \\nNNRTI resistance appears fast, possibly due to their long half-life (Muro 2005). This\\nis why NNRTIs should always be stopped some days before the other drugs if a break\\nin therapy is planned (see chapter on Treatment Interruption). If resistance develops,\\nthe drug should be stopped in order to avoid additional mutations which may com-\\npromise second generation or future NNRTIs. Moreover, the replication capacity of\\nHIV is not reduced as much by NNRTI mutations as by some PI or NRTI mutations\\n(Piketty 2004). In Europe, the prevalence of NNRTI resistance mutations in untreated\\npatients is currently 2-3% (Vercauteren 2009). This is why a resistence test should\\nbe done before initiation of NNRTIs.\\nDespite the problems with resistance, both randomized and large cohort studies have\\ndemonstrated that NNRTIs are extremely effective when combined with nucleoside\\nanalogs. The immunologic and virologic potency of NNRTIs in treatment-naïve\\npatients is at least equivalent to that of PIs (Torre 2001, Robbins 2003, MacArthur\\n2006, Riddler 2008, Daar 2011, DeJesus 2011, Soriano 2011). However, the efficacy\\nof NNRTIs in treatment-experienced patients is probably weaker in comparison to\\nPIs (Yazdanpanah 2004). \\nThe simple dosing and overall tolerability have enabled nevirapine, efavirenz and\\nrilpivirine to become important components of ART regimens, which are often\\nranked higher than those containing PIs. Over the last few years, many randomized\\nstudies have demonstrated that it is possible to switch from a PI to an NNRTI if good\\nvirological suppression has already been achieved. The efficacy was sometimes even\\nbetter on NNRTIs than on the continued PI regimen (see chapter When to Switch).\\nAll NNRTIs are metabolized by the cytochrome p450 system. Nevirapine is an inducer,\\nwhereas efavirenz is an inducer and an inhibitor of p450. In the combination of\\nefavirenz plus lopinavir the effects are so strong that dose adjustment is necessary.\\nSo far, no study has provided definitive and convincing evidence that one NNRTI is\\nmore potent than another. Whereas delavirdine no longer has any significant role\\n82 ART'),\n",

In the 2NN Study (The\\nDouble Non-Nucleoside Study), both agents were compared in a large-scale\\n randomized study (Van Leth 2004). A total of 1,216 patients received a nuke back-\\nbone of d4T+3TC with either nevirapine 1 x 400 mg, nevirapine 2 x 200 mg, efavirenz\\n1 x 600 mg or efavirenz 1 x 800 mg plus nevirapine 1 x 400 mg. The only signifi-\\ncant virological difference was an advantage of the efavirenz arm over the double\\nNNRTI arm, mainly due to higher toxicity in the latter. In the nevirapine arm with\\n1 x 400 mg, severe hepatic side effects occurred more frequently than in the efavirenz\\narm; on the other hand, lipids were more favorably influenced in the nevirapine\\ngroup. Sub-analyses of 2NN have shown that the hepatic toxicity associated with\\nonce-daily doses of nevirapine was observed in a single center in Thailand (Storfer\\n2005). In another randomized trial no increased risk for hepatotoxicity was observed\\nin patients on once-daily nevirapine (Podzamczer 2008). In a subanalysis of the FIRST\\ntrial there were no differences with regard to efficacy between nevirapine and\\nefavirenz (van den Berg 2008). In a small study more patients in ultrasensitive assays\\nwere below the detection level of 1 copy/ml with nevapirine than with efavirenz\\n(Haïm-Boukobza 2011). In contrast, virological efficacy was lower with nevirapine\\nin patients with TB (Bonnet 2013).\\nSince 2008, etravirine, a second-generation NNRTI can be an option for patients with\\nNNRTI resistance mutations from nevirapine or efavirenz. Another second-genera-\\ntion NNRTI, rilpivirine, was approved in 2011. In large studies comparable efficacy\\nof rilpivirine and efavirenz was shown, however, limited to patients with a baseline\\nviremia of less than 100,000 HIV RNA copies/ml (see below). \\nIndividual agents: Special features and problems\\nDelavirdine (DLV, Rescriptor®) was, in April 1997, the second NNRTI to be licensed\\nby the FDA. Delavirdine is not licensed in Europe where, in 1999, an application for\\nlicensure was rejected due to insufficient efficacy data. Due to the pill burden and\\nthe required three times daily dosing, delavirdine is currently rarely prescribed. \\nEfavirenz (EFV, Sustiva\\n®, Stocrin ®, also in Atripla®) was the third NNRTI to be\\napproved, and the first for which it could be shown that NNRTIs were at least as\\neffective and maybe better than PIs in untreated or only slightly treatment-experi-\\nenced patients. In particular, the 006 Study showed superiority of efavirenz over\\n indinavir (Staszewski 1999). Since then efavirenz has often been compared to other\\ndrugs. In AI424-034 and ACTG 5202 it was at least as effective as atazanavir and\\natazanavir/r respectively (Squires 2004, Daar 2011). In ACTG 5142, efavirenz\\nappeared to be superior to lopinavir/r although resistance mutations were more\\n frequently observed in the efavirenz arm (Riddler 2008). Newer studies comparing\\nefavirenz to rilpivirine or integrase inhibitors (see there) have shown inferiority to\\ndolutegravir, mainly due to tolerability. \\nIn many guidelines, efavirenz is still among the preferred drugs for treatment-naïve\\npatients. However, there are some problems with its use, mainly CNS side effects. It\\nis recommended to be taken in the evening before going to sleep. Patients should\\nbe warned about dizziness and numbness, vivid dreams or even nightmares.\\nPotentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery are inadvisable.\\nThe side effects probably correlate with high plasma levels (Marzolini 2001). Black\\npatients seem to have a genetic predisposition to the CNS effects (Haas 2004, Wyen\\n2008). The mechanism of CNS toxicity remains unclear. There is some evidence that\\nmetabolites may contribute to neurotoxicity (Tovar-y-Romo 2013). Efavirenz  disrupts\\nsleep architecture (Gallego 2004).

Although these symptoms seem\\nto resolve during the course of treatment, they may persist in about one fifth of\\npatients (Lochet 2003). In such cases, efavirenz should be replaced if possible. A large\\nrandomized study has recently shown that 400 mg efavirenz have similar efficacy\\ncompared to 600 mg and are better tolerated (Encore 2014). However, this approach\\nhas not yet been validated in clinical routine.\\nLipids are not as favorably affected as with nevirapine (Parienti 2007), etravirine\\n(Fätkenheuer 2012) or rilpivirine (Behrens 2014). Gynecomastia is seen on efavirenz,\\nwhich is not only a psychological burden, but can be physically painful as well\\n(Rahim 2004). Efavirenz is teratogenic and contraindicated in pregnancy. Although,\\naccording to a newer meta-analysis, the teratogenic risk is relatively low (Ford 2011),\\nefavirenz should be avoided in women of child-bearing age. \\nEtravirine (ETV, Intelence\\n®) is a diarylpyrimidine (DAPY) analog developed by\\nJanssen-Cilag. This second-generation NNRTI was approved in 2008 for  antiretroviral\\ntreatment-experienced adult patients. Etravirine works well against wild-type viruses,\\nas well as resistant mutants, among them the classical NNRTI mutations such as\\nK103N (Andries 2004). The genetic resistance barrier is higher than that of other\\nNNRTIs. This appears to be because by changing its confirmation etravirine can bind\\nvery flexibly to the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (Vingerhoets 2005). Mutations at the\\nenzyme binding site therefore hardly affect the binding and therefore the potency\\nof this NNRTI (Das 2004). The reduction of etravirine activity by resistance muta-\\ntions appears to occur slower in patients on a nevirapine-failing regimen compared\\nto efavirenz (Cozzi-Lepri 2012). \\nIn Phase I/II studies, etravirine lowered viral load by an average of 1.99 logs in\\n treatment-naïve patients after only one week (Gruzdev 2003) and by 0.89 logs in the\\npresence of NNRTI mutations (Gazzard 2003). In C233, a large Phase II trial on\\n199 patients with NNRTI and PI mutations, who had previously been intensively\\ntreated, the viral load was significantly lower than the placebo arm after 48 weeks\\n(TMC125 Writing Group 2007). Another Phase II study (C227) brought a setback\\nwhen etravirine was compared with an investigator-selected PI in NNRTI-resistant,\\nPI-naïve patients. In an unplanned interim analysis, patients receiving etravirine\\ndemonstrated suboptimal virological responses relative to the control PI and trial\\nenrolment was stopped prematurely (Ruxrungtham 2008). The sponsor argued that\\nin this study baseline resistance was higher than expected. The formulation of\\netravirine used then also showed poor bioavailability, which has since been improved\\n(Kakuda 2008). Up to now there is no evidence of a correlation between pharmaco-\\nkinetic data and virological success (Kakuda 2010). \\nTwo phase III studies, DUET-1 and -2, led to the approval of etravirine. In these,\\n1,203 patients on a failing ART regimen with resistance to currently available NNRTIs\\nand at least three primary PI mutations were randomly assigned to receive either\\netravirine or placebo, each given twice daily with darunavir/r, investigator-selected\\nNRTIs, and optional T-20 (Lazzarin 2007, Madruga 2007). After 96 weeks 57% of\\npatients on etravirine achieved a viral load of less than 50 copies/ml compared to\\n36% on the placebo arm (Katlama 2010). However, the overall effect of etravirine\\ndecreased with an increasing number of NNRTI resistance mutations. As with all\\nARVs, etravirine needs active partner agents to develop full efficacy (Tambuyzer 2010,\\nTrottier 2010). \\nIn most cases, etravirine is well-tolerated (Cohen 2009). In the DUET trials, tolera-\\nbility was comparable to placebo. Only the typical NNRTI rash was observed more\\nfrequently (19% versus 11%) although rash was mostly mild (Katlama 2009).

A switch from\\nefavirenz to etravirine can help reduce CNS side effects and improve lipid profiles\\n(Gazzard 2011, Waters 2011, Faetkenheuer 2012). However, patients who are\\n tolerating efavirenz will see no advantage in the switch (Ngyen 2011).\\nThere does not appear to be any relevant interaction with methadone or with anti-\\nretroviral agents, with one exception: the level of etravirine is lowered significantly\\nwhen combined with tipranavir (Kakuda 2006). Etravirine, at a dose of 400 mg (2 x\\n200 mg tablets BID), should be taken with a meal as this increases absorption. Tablets\\ncan be dissolved in water. Once-daily dosing seems to be possible but has not been\\napproved (Fätkenheuer 2012). \\nIn conclusion, etravirine is an important and well-tolerated option for patients with\\nNNRTI resistance. Current data suggest that etravirine should always be combined\\nwith a boosted PI, preferably darunavir/r. \\nNevirapine (NVP, Viramune\\n®) was the first licensed NNRTI in 1997. The combina-\\ntion of nevirapine with AZT+ddI is probably the oldest triple combination of all\\n(D’Aquila 1996). In early randomized studies nevirapine performed comparably to\\nindinavir (van Leeuwen 2003) and better than nelfinavir (Podzamczer 2002). Studies\\nsuch as ARTEN or NEWART showed that the virological efficacy was comparable to\\nboosted atazanavir (DeJesus 2011, Soriano 2011). However, some studies reported\\non a higher risk for virological failure with nevirapine compared to lopinavir. This\\nwas mainly observed in the setting of concurrent TB therapy or in women who had\\nreceived single-dose nevirapine transmission prophylaxis (Boltz 2011, Swaminathan\\n2011, Clumeck 2012). \\nNevirapine is usually well-tolerated, even in the long-term. It has a favorable impact\\non lipid changes compared to other drugs (Van der Valk 2001, Van Leth 2004). In\\nthe ARTEN trial, the lipid profile was even better than with atazanavir/r (Podzamczer\\n2011). In one small randomized trial, lipid profiles improved when efavirenz was\\nreplaced by nevirapine (Parienti 2007). Whether these positive effects will have\\n clinical relevance and really help prevent cardiovascular events remains to be seen.\\nNevirapine causes elevation of liver enzymes in up to 20% of people, which may\\noccasionally be severe. Lead-in dosing is always required. During the first eight weeks\\non nevirapine, biweekly monitoring of transaminases is recommended. A rash devel-\\nops in 15-20% and leads to discontinuation in up to 7% (Miller 1997). Prophylactic\\nadministration of antihistamines or steroids does not prevent the rash (GESIDA 2004,\\nLaunay 2004). In the case of an isolated rash or isolated elevation of transaminases\\n(up to five times the upper limit of normal), treatment can usually be continued but\\nuse caution if both occur simultaneously. It is recommended to stop treatment if a\\nrash occurs together with even a slight elevation of transaminases (>2-fold ULN). It\\nis important to note that hepatic toxicity may occur even after several months\\n(Sulkowski 2002). Patients with chronic hepatitis are at higher risk, as are women\\nwith low body weight (Sulkowski 2000, Sanne 2005, Kappelhoff 2005). \\nAn increased risk has also been reported for patients with good immune status.\\nWomen with CD4 T cells above 250/µl have a 12-fold elevated risk (11% versus 0.9%)\\nof hepatic toxicity. In men there is an increased risk above 400 cells/µl (6.3% versus\\n1.2%). Although other studies failed to reveal an association between toxicity and\\nimmune status (Manfredi 2006, Wolf 2006, Chu 2010), it is recommended not to\\nuse nevirapine in treatment-naïve patients with higher CD4 T cell counts. In con-\\ntrast, in ART-experienced patients switching to nevirapine, the risk is not elevated\\n(Mocroft 2007, De Lazzari 2008, Wit 2008). Since 2010, the package information\\nindicates that a switch to nevapirine is possible at a viral load of 50 copies/ml, regard-\\nless of CD4 T cell count.\\n6.2.

However, there is currently no test\\navailable to predict hypersensitivity (Yuan 2011). Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase\\n(GGT) elevations are very common, which may subject patients to false appearances\\nof excess alcohol consumption.\\nAfter several studies in both treatment-naïve and –experienced patients (Gathe 2011,\\nArasteh 2012), a nevapirine extended-release (NVP XR) formulation was approved\\nin 2011, allowing once-daily dosing. The patients should know that the XR tablets\\nare formulated in a non-digestible cellulose-based matrix, which may be seen in the\\nfeces. These softened tablet remnants may sometimes resemble whole tablets, but\\nare inactive ingredients. Thus, there is no need to worry when patients observe tablets\\nin their stool. The old 200 mg tablets are avaible as generics. \\nRilpivirine (RPV, Edurant\\n®, also in Complera® or Eviplera®) was approved in 2011.\\nLike etravirine, it is also a DAPY NNRTI (Janssen 2005). It has a very long half-life\\nof 40 hours. A Phase IIa study on therapy-naïve patients receiving monotherapy for\\n7 days decreased viral load by 1.2 logs but no dose-dependent effect between 25 and\\n150 mg was seen (Goebel 2005). The lowest dosage of 25 mg which is far lower than\\nthat of other NNRTIs was used in the development program.\\nIn treatment naïve patients, rilpivirine has been tested in three large trials against\\nefavirenz. In two Phase III trials (ECHO and THRIVE) on 1,368 patients a compara-\\nble effect with better tolerability was observed at 48-96 weeks (Cohen 2011, Molina\\n2011, Behrens 2014). Rilpivirine was associated with lower increases in lipid\\n parameters and fewer dyslipidemia than efavirenz. Body fat distribution changes\\nwere similar. In the third large trial (STaR), the two single-tablet regimens Complera\\n®\\n(rilpivirine plus TDF+FTC) and Atripla® (efavirenz plus TDF+FTC) were studied. This\\nrandomized, open-label on 786 patients demonstrated non-inferior efficacy and\\nimproved tolerability compared to efavirenz. After 48 weeks, 89% versus 82% of the\\npatients had reached an undetectable viral load, respectively. There were fewer\\n discontinuations because of adverse events.\\nHowever, resistance as well as virological failure were observed more frequently with\\nrilpivirine. In ECHO and THRIVE the rates were 9% vs 5%, in STaR 4% vs. 1%, respec-\\ntively (Cohen 2012+2014). Resistance mutations were mainly seen in the NNRTI loci\\n(mainly E138K or K101E) but also in the NNRTI region (Rimsky 2012). Compared\\nto efavirenz, the risk of resistance-associated virologic failure was significantly\\n elevated in highly viremic patients. Thus, the approval of rilpivirine is restricted to\\npatients with a baseline viral load of less than 100,000 copies/ml. \\nOverall, rilpivirine is well tolerated. CNS side effects may occur but are less inten-\\nsive than seen with efavirenz. The QT prolongation observed earlier (at a higher\\ndose), seems to occur less frequently at 25 mg (Vanveggel 2009) and the teratogenic\\nrisk is small (Desmidt 2009). A parenteral nano-suspension is being investigated, in\\nwhich ripilvirine levels are achieved via monthly injections, corresponding to a daily\\ndose of 25 mg (Verloes 2008). Rilpivirine currently plays an important role in long-\\nacting strategies.\\nIn 2013, rilpivirine was also approved for treatment-experienced patients. In the\\nSPIRIT trial, 476 patients with viral suppression have been randomized to remain on\\ntheir PI-based regimen or to switch to rilpivirine. The switch was safe and improved\\nlipid changes seen with PIs (Palella 2012). \\nIn conclusion, rilpivirine has become an important option in antiretroviral therapy.\\nA certain disadvantage in everyday practice is the requirement that the substance\\nmust be taken with food (a fatty meal of at least 500 kcal is necessary) to guarantee\\n86 ART'),\n",

There three widely used\\nboosted PIs: atazanavir, darunavir and lopinavir. Current data suggest that the\\n differences are not significant enough to completely rule out any of these agents.\\nBesides gastrointestinal side effects and relatively high pill burden (no STRs avail-\\nable), all PIs used in long-term therapy show tolerability problems – to a greater or\\nlesser extent, all are associated with lipodystrophy and dyslipidemia (Nolan 2003).\\nOther problems include drug interactions, which can sometimes be substantial.\\nCardiac arrhythmias (Anson 2005) and sexual dysfunction have also been attributed\\nto PIs (Schrooten 2001), although the data does not remain unchallenged (Lallemand\\n2002).\\nAll PIs are inhibitors of the CYP3A4 system and interact with many other drugs (see\\nchapter on Drug Interactions). Ritonavir is the strongest inhibitor, saquinavir proba-\\nbly the weakest. There is a high degree of cross-resistance between protease inhibitors,\\nwhich was described even before PIs were put on the market (Condra 1995). With\\ndarunavir and tipranavir two second-generation PIs are available that are effective\\neven in the presence of several resistance mutations (see below). All PIs must be\\nboostered by the so called pharmacoenhancers, in order to achieve sufficient plasma\\nlevels. \\nWhy boost PIs?\\nRitonavir is a potent inhibitor of the isoenzyme 3A4, a subunit of the cytochrome\\nP450 hepatic enzyme system. Inhibition of these gastrointestinal and hepatic\\nenzymes allows the most important pharmacokinetic parameters of almost all PIs to\\nbe significantly increased or “boosted” (Kempf 1997): maximum concentration\\n(Cmax), trough levels (Ctrough or Cmin) and half-life. The interaction between riton-\\navir and the other PIs simplifies daily regimens by reducing the frequency and\\nnumber of pills to be taken every day, in many cases independent of food intake.\\nMost PIs can now be used in once-daily regimens. There are two pharmacoenhancers\\navailable. Ritonavir (Norvir\\n®) can be combined with all PIs. In 2014, cobicistat\\n(Tybost®) was approved as a booster for atazanavir and darunavir.\\nInitially, cobicistat was developed for the integrase inhibitor elvitegravir in the fixed-\\ndose combination Stribild\\n® that came to market in 2013. PK studies, however, had\\nshown that with cobicistat comparable levels of atazanavir and darunavir can be\\nachieved (Elion 2011, Kakuda 2014). In a double-blind,  randomized study on 692\\nART-naive patients treated with TDF+FTC+atazanavir,  efficacy and tolerability of\\ncobicistat and ritonavir were comparable (Gallant 2013). Based on these data, cobici-\\nstat is now available as pharmacoenhancer for atazanavir and darunavir. More\\nrecently, the FDA and EMA have granted marketing approval to two fixed-dose com-\\nbinations. Evotaz\\n® is a combination of atazanavir and cobicistat, Prezcobix ® or\\nRezolsta® contains cobicistat and darunavir. Cobicistat seems to be well-tolerated,\\nalthough a slight increase of creatinine was noted. This may only be explained by a\\nlessened tubular creatinine secretion and may not indicate an impairment of renal\\nfunction (German 2013). \\nBoosting with ritonavir or cobicistat is usually indicated by addition of an “/r” or a\\n“/c” after the drug name (see Table 2.4). Resistance is only rarely observed on boosted\\nPIs, at least in ART–naïve patients, as the genetic barrier is high. This has been shown\\nnot only for lopinavir/r (Hammer 2006), but also for fosamprenavir/r (Eron 2006),\\natazanavir/r (Mallan 2008), saquinavir/r (Ananworanich 2006) and darunavir/r (Ortiz\\n2008). Many experts therefore recommend that in highly viremic patients, prefer-\\nably PI/r-based regimens should be used. \\n6.2. Overview of antiretroviral agents    91'),\n",

However, at least one large randomized study evaluating TDM-\\nguided dose escalation of boosted PIs in almost 200 patients with extensive resist-\\nance mutations failed to show a significant benefit with this strategy (Albrecht 2011).\\nBoosting is also associated with risks. There is a high degree of variability in plasma\\nlevels among individuals. As well as trough levels, peak levels are also elevated, which\\nmay lead to more side effects. If in doubt (reduced efficacy, more side effects), plasma\\nlevels should be measured in cases of boosting, especially in patients with severe\\nhepatic disease, because the extent of interaction cannot be predetermined for\\n individual cases. Dose adjustment is often necessary. \\nIndividual agents: Special features and problems \\nAmprenavir (APV, Agenerase®) was the fifth PI to enter the market in 2000. It was\\nreplaced by fosamprenavir in 2004 (Telzir® or Lexiva®, see below) and subsequently\\nwithdrawn from market. \\nAtazanavir (ATV, Reyataz®, also in Evotaz®) was licensed in 2004 as the first PI on\\nthe market for once daily administration. In treatment-naïve patients, atazanavir\\nwas compared to many other agents. Both boosted and unboosted atazanavir proved\\nas effective as efavirenz (Squires 2004, Daar 2011) or nevirapine (Soriano 2011). The\\nCASTLE study proved that virological efficacy of atazanavir/r was at least as good or\\neven better with more favorable lipid profiles and better gastrointestinal tolerability\\nthan lopinavir/r (Molina 2008+2010). In the three-arm study ACTG 5257, however,\\natazanavir was inferior to raltegravir and darunavir in a tolerability endpoint.\\nAtazanavir was also inferior to darunavir in the combined efficacy/safety endpoint\\n(Lennox 2014). \\nAlthough several studies have shown no difference between boosted and unboosted\\natazanavir (Malan 2008, Squires 2012), boosting with ritonavir or cobicistat is\\n recommended (Focà 2013). Unboosted atazanavir is slightly less effective than\\nlopinavir in treatment-experienced patients (Cohen 2005). When boosted, it is\\n comparable to lopinavir, at least when PI resistance is limited (Johnson 2006). \\nIn comparison to lopinavir, atazanavir does not have such negative effects on lipid\\nlevels. However, it is not yet clear whether this is clinically relevant. Contrasting\\nwith earlier reports, recent data suggest that boosting atazanavir with ritonavir seems\\nto have some negative effects on lipid levels (Review: Carey 2010). Moreover, current\\ndata suggest that there are no differences compared to darunavir/r (Aberg 2012,\\n92 ART'),\n",

There is at least one randomized study showing no beneficial\\neffect on body changes after a switch from other boosted PIs to atazanavir/r (Moyle\\n2012). In a randomized trial on treatment-naïve patients, compared to the efavirenz\\ngroup, subjects assigned to atazanavir/r had even a trend towards higher mean\\n percentage increase in visceral fat (McComsey 2011). \\nMore than half of patients on atazanavir experience elevated bilirubin levels, which\\ncan reach grade 3–4 in approximately one third of all cases (Squires 2004, Soriano\\n2008). Some patients even develop jaundice. In ACTG 5237, 8% of the patients dis-\\ncontinued atazanavir due to this adverse event (Lennox 2014). The mechanism\\nresembles that of Gilbert’s Syndrome; there is reduced conjugation in the liver. A\\ngenetic predisposition has been identified (Rotger 2005). Although the hyperbiliru-\\nbinemia is understood to be harmless and only few cases of serious hepatic  disorders\\nhave been published to date (Eholie 2004), liver function should be monitored.\\nTreatment should be discontinued in cases of significantly elevated bilirubin \\n(>5–6 times the upper limit of normal). Unfavorable interactions occur in combi-\\nnation with proton pump inhibitors (see chapter on Drug Interactions). Boosting is\\nrecommended, particularly for combinations including NNRTIs, tenofovir or\\n raltegravir, which significantly lower atazanavir levels (Le Tiec 2005). \\nThe primary resistance mutation for this drug is I50L, which does not impair\\n sensitivity to other PIs (Colonno 2003). On the other hand, there are a number of\\ncross-resistant mutations and susceptibility to many viral isolates with moderate PI\\nresistance is reduced (Schnell 2003). \\nDarunavir (DRV, Prezista\\n®, also in Prezicom® or Rezolsta®) is a nonpeptidic PI,\\ndeveloped by Janssen-Cilag. Due to its impressive potency in the presence of PI-resis-\\ntant mutants (Koh 2003), darunavir was initially an important drug for therapy-\\nexperienced patients with limited options. In 2008 the license was extended to ART\\nnaïve patients. Two Phase II studies, POWER-I (US) and -2 (Europe) sped up the licens-\\ning in 2006/2007. Both trials included nearly 600 patients with extensive pretreat-\\nment (three classes and an average of 11 drugs) and high resistance (Clotet 2007).\\nDespite considerable resistance at baseline, 46% in the 600/100 mg BID group\\nachieved a viral load of less than 50 copies/ml at 48 weeks. This rate was signifi-\\ncantly higher compared to the control PI (10%) and a success that had thus far not\\nbeen seen in this patient group with such limited options. Encouraging results in\\nsalvage treatment were also reported from the DUET trials, in which darunavir was\\ncombined with etravirine (see above).\\nIn patients with moderate pre-treatment, darunavir/r was superior to lopinavir/r. In\\nthe TITAN study with 595 (lopinavir-naïve) patients, mainly pretreated with PIs, at\\n48 weeks 71% showed a viral load of below 50 copies/ml compared to 60% on\\nlopinavir (Madruga 2007). Superiority was observed in all patient groups. Virologic\\nfailure and resistance against associated agents were significantly less on darunavir.\\nOf note, efficacy was not compromised by the occurrence of PI resistant mutations\\n(De Meyer 2008+2009). \\nIn 2008, the license was extended to treatment-naïve patients. The ARTEMIS trial\\ndemonstrated comparable efficacy of once-daily darunavir/r compared to lopinavir/r\\n(Ortiz 2008, Mills 2009). Once-daily darunavir/r also showed potential in treatment-\\nexperienced patients with no darunavir resistance mutations (De Meyer 2008, Cahn\\n2011, Lathouwers 2013). More recently, darunavir was tested against  integrase\\ninhibitors. Although its high genetic barrier was confirmed in randomized trials such\\nas FLAMINGO or ACTG 5237 (not a single resistance mutation detected), darunavir\\nperformed slightly worse than dolutegravir or raltegravir. This was mainly due to a\\nlower tolerability which was driven by its gastrointestinal side effects (Clotet 2014,\\n6.2. Overview of antiretroviral agents    93'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 9.5.5 (Windows)', 'creator': 'PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2', 'creationdate': '2020-12-07T12:26:56+01:00', 'author': 'Gerald', 'moddate': '2020-12-07T12:32:18+01:00', 'title': 'HIV2015_GB_HIV2015_GB', 'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ravig\\\\MedicalBot\\\\Medical-Bot\\\\research\\\\Data\\\\medicalbook.pdf', 'total_pages': 775, 'page': 112, 'page_label': '94'}, page_content='Lennox 2014). However, these are moderate and less severe than with other PIs\\n(Clotet 2007, Madruga 2007). Rash, occuring in up to 5%, is usually mild. Relevant\\ninteractions occur with lopinavir causing a decrease of plasma levels of darunavir.\\nThis combination must be avoided. The same applies for sildenafil and estrogen.\\nThe potency of darunavir is, of course, not unlimited. 11 mutations associated with\\nresistance were identified in the POWER studies. These mutations are usually located\\nat codons 32, 47, 50 and 87 (De Meyer 2006). With accumulation of at least three\\nmutations, susceptibility is reduced (Pozniak 2008). The in vitro susceptibility pat-\\nterns of darunavir and fosamprenavir are very similar. However, predicted incidence\\nof  clinically meaningful cross-resistance is low, due to differences in clinical cut-offs,\\nwhich are higher for darunavir (Parkin 2008). Thus, pretreatment with amprenavir\\nor  fosamprenavir does not appear to compromise efficacy. In view of the high resist-\\nance barrier, there are several trials currently testing darunavir as monotherapy (see\\nbelow). In 2014, a single pill formulation that contains darunavir plus the pharma-\\ncoenhancer cobicistat was approved (US: Prezcobix\\n®, EU: Rezolsta®). Other fixed-dose\\ncombination pills of darunavir/c (plus TAF+FTC or 3TC) are in progress.\\nFosamprenavir (Telzir®, USA: Lexiva®) has better solubility and absorption than its\\noriginal version, amprenavir. It was licensed in 2004. The recommended doses are\\neither unboosted 1400 mg BID (not licensed in Europe!) or boosted with ritonavir\\nas 700/100 mg BID or 1400/200 mg QD. Once-daily dosing is not recommended for\\ntreatment-experienced patients. A recent trial suggested that for once-daily dosing,\\n100 mg ritonavir is sufficient (Hicks 2009).\\nIn treatment-naïve patients, fosamprenavir/r QD was as effective as atazanavir/r in\\nthe relatively small ALERT study (Smith 2006). No resistance was found with fos-\\namprenavir/r even after 48 weeks (MacManus 2004). In the KLEAN study (Eron 2006),\\nfosamprenavir/r twice daily in treatment-naïve patients provides similar antiviral\\nefficacy as lopinavir/r, each in combination with ABC+3TC. Severe diarrhea and cho-\\nlesterol elevations occurred at the same frequency. In treatment-experienced patients\\nin the CONTEXT study, fosamprenavir was not quite as effective as lopinavir/r\\nalthough the difference was not significant (Elston 2004). \\nFosamprenavir currently does not play an important role in HIV medicine. There is\\nno convincing argument for its use. One advantage of the drug is that there are no\\nrestrictions with respect to food intake. It is important to note that efavirenz can\\nsignificantly lower plasma levels, as can nevirapine, although this does not occur\\nwhen fosamprenavir is boosted (Elston 2004). \\nIndinavir (IDV, Crixivan\\n®) was one of the first PIs, initially very successful in large\\nstudies (Gulick 1997, Hammer 1997). Its main problem is tolerability. Firstly, it causes\\nnephrolithiasis in 5–25% (Meraviglia 2002) and thus requires good hydration (at\\nleast 1.5 liters daily). Unboosted indinavir must be taken three times daily on an\\nempty stomach (Haas 2000). When boosted at 2 x 800/100 mg, tolerability is poor.\\nSide effects resemble those of retinoid therapy: alopecia, dry skin and lips, and\\ningrown nails. Many patients also develop asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia.\\nAlthough it seems that the dose and toxicity can be reduced by TDM (Wasmuth\\n2007), indinavir does no longer play a role.\\nLopinavir/r (LPV, Kaletra\\n®) was licensed in April 2001 and is so far the only PI with\\na fixed boosting dose of ritonavir. This increases concentrations of lopinavir by more\\nthan 100-fold (Sham 1998). In 2006, the old Kaletra\\n® capsules were replaced by\\ntablets, allowing a pill reduction (Gathe 2008). Lopinavir is still the most frequently\\nprescribed PI worldwide and has also been licensed as once-daily since 2009 after\\nseveral studies showed efficacy and tolerability (Molina 2007, Gathe 2009, Gonzalez-\\nGarcia 2010). However, other studies found a slightly reduced potency of QD dosing\\n94 ART'),\n",

Lopinavir QD is therefore only recommended if the\\nnumber of PI resistance mutations is low. \\nIn treatment-naïve patients, lopinavir/r was significantly superior to an unboosted\\nregimen with nelfinavir (Walmsley 2002). It was regarded as the preferred PI for years.\\nHowever, more recently, large randomized trials such as KLEAN, GEMINI, ARTEMIS\\nand CASTLE have shown that there are no significant differences compared to\\nboosted PIs such as fosamprenavir/r (Eron 2006), saquinavir/r (Walmsley 2009), or\\natazanavir/r (Molina 2008). In ACTG 5142, lopinavir/r was inferior to efavirenz\\n(Riddler 2008), possibly due to lower tolerability. \\nIn treatment-experienced patients, lopinavir/r showed slightly better results than\\nboosted saquinavir (the old Fortovase\\n® formulation) in an open-label randomized\\ntrial (MaxCmin2) on a heterogeneous population of treatment-experienced patients.\\nThis was particularly true for tolerability, but also with respect to treatment failure\\n(Dragstedt 2005). On the other hand, in two smaller studies in PI-experienced\\npatients, virologic efficacy of lopinavir/r was not significantly higher than that of\\nboosted atazanavir (Johnson 2006) or fosamprenavir (Elston 2004). In comparison\\nto darunavir, efficacy was even lower (Madruga 2007, De Meyer 2009).\\nDevelopment of resistance in first-line is rare, but is theoretically possible (Kagan\\n2003, Conradie 2004, Friend 2004). Lopinavir/r has a high genetic barrier to\\n resistance, and it is likely that at least 6-8 cumulative PI resistance mutations are\\nnecessary for treatment failure (Kempf 2002). That is why lopinavir is also  considered\\nfor monotherapies (see below).\\nA significant concern with lopinavir are the gastrointestinal side effects (diarrhea,\\nbloating) which are probably more frequent on a once-daily dosage (Johnson 2006).\\nIn addition, lipodystrophy and often considerable dyslipidemia, have been observed,\\nprobably more marked than with atazanavir (Molina 2008, Mallolas 2009), darunavir\\n(Mills 2009) and saquinavir (Walmsley 2009), but not more so than with fosampre-\\nnavir (Eron 2006). A number of interactions should also be considered. The dose\\nmust be increased in combination with efavirenz and nevirapine, probably also with\\nconcurrent administration of fosamprenavir.\\nNelfinavir (NFV, Viracept\\n®) was the fourth PI on the market. Due to high pill burden,\\ndiarrhea and a lower antiviral potency, nelfinavir no longer plays much of a role in\\nHIV treatment. In Europe, production has been discontinued.\\nRitonavir (RTV, Norvir\\n®) was the first PI for which efficacy was proven on the basis\\nof clinical endpoints (Cameron 1998). However, ritonavir is now obsolete as a single\\nPI, since tolerability is poor. As gastrointestinal complaints and perioral paresthesias\\ncan be very disturbing, ritonavir is now only given to boost other PIs. The “baby\\ndose” used for this purpose (100 mg QD) is better-tolerated. Ritonavir inhibits its\\nown metabolism via the cytochrome P450 pathway. The potent enzyme induction\\nresults in a high potential for interactions. Many drugs are contraindicated for\\n concomitant administration with ritonavir. Metabolic disorders probably occur more\\nfrequently than with other PIs. Caution should be exercised in the presence of\\nimpaired liver function. It is no longer necessary to store ritonavir at cool tempera-\\ntures thanks to the Meltrex formulation that came onto the market in 2010. \\nSaquinavir (Invirase 500\\n®), previously Invirase®, Fortovase®, was the first HIV PI\\nto be licensed in December 1995, and is still one of the few agents with efficacy based\\non clinical endpoints (Stellbrink 2000). Boosting with ritonavir raises the plasma\\nlevel sufficiently, as does simultaneous food intake, so saquinavir should be taken\\nwith meals. The hard gel (Invirase\\n®) and soft gel (Fortovase®) capsules were replaced\\nin 2005 by Invirase 500® tablets, which significantly reduced the number of pills to\\nsix a day (including ritonavir boosting).

There were no significant differences with respect to efficacy at 48 weeks\\n(Walmsley 2009). Some adverse effects such as lipid elevations were less pronounced\\nwith saquinavir, as was diarrhea. However, discontinuation rates due to adverse\\nevents were comparable between arms. During recent years, several warning letters\\nwere published, regarding QT prolongation and the need for ECG monitoring with\\nsaquinavir. Treatment naïve patients should be started on a reduced dose of 500 mg\\nBID for the first seven days, before increasing to the standard dose of 1000 mg BID\\n(always in conjunction with ritonavir 100 mg BID). In addition to baseline, the ECG\\nshould now be performed after approximately 10 days of treatment. Nobody wants\\nthis. Thus, it is difficult find any reason for starting saquinavir. \\nTipranavir (TPV, Aptivus\\n®) is the first non-peptidic PI licensed in Europe in July\\n2005 for treatment-experienced patients. As oral bioavailability is only moderate,\\ndouble the standard ritonavir boosting (McCallister 2004) is necessary, so 2 x 200 mg\\n(BID) has to be used. The plasma levels can also be increased by a high fat meal.\\nTipranavir shows good efficacy against PI-resistant viruses (Larder 2000). However,\\nefficacy is not limitless – with a combination of the above mutations, sensitivity\\ndeclines significantly (Baxter 2006). \\nRESIST-1 (USA) and RESIST-2 (Europe) were two Phase III studies on 1,483 intensively\\npretreated but viremic patients with at least one primary PI mutation. All patients\\nreceived either tipranavir/r or a comparison PI/r, each combined with an optimized\\nbackground therapy. After 48 weeks, virologic and immunologic response to\\ntipranavir was better than with the comparison PI (Hicks 2006).\\nA significant problem with tipranavir, apart from dyslipidemia (grade 3-4 increase\\nin triglycerides: 22% vs 13% for the comparison PI), is an increase in transaminases\\nwhich is sometimes substantial (grade 3–4: 7% versus 1%) and requires careful mon-\\nitoring. In treatment-naïve patients, tipranavir/r was less effective than lopinavir/r,\\nmainly due to more adverse events leading to discontinuation (Cooper 2006). In\\naddition, some unfavorable interactions also occur. Plasma levels of many PIs fall\\nsignificantly, so that double PI therapy with tipranavir is not recommended. As the\\nlevels of AZT, abacavir and etravirine also drop, these combinations are not recom-\\nmendable either. ddI has to be taken with a two-hour time delay. \\nTipranavir remains an important option in extensively treated patients harboring\\nPI-resistant viruses. A study that directly compared tipranavir/r to darunavir/r was\\nhalted due to slow accrual. Cross-trial comparisons between these drugs should be\\ndiscouraged as patient populations in the RESIST (tipranavir/r) studies differed con-\\nsiderably from those of the POWER (darunavir/r) trials. \\nReferences \\nAberg JA, Tebas P, Overton ET, et al.

It is involved in the integration of the viral\\nDNA into the host genome and is essential for the replication of HIV (Nair 2002). It\\nis of note that there is no integrase in human cells so selective inhibition of this\\nenzyme that does not induce side effects seems possible. \\nThere are at least four steps leading to the integration of viral DNA (Review: Lataillade\\n2006). All these steps may be theoretically inhibited by different integrase inhibitors.\\nBriefly, these steps are:\\n1. Binding of the integrase enzyme to viral DNA within the cytoplasm. This results\\nin a stable viral DNA-integrase binding complex (pre-integration complex, PIC).\\nThis step can be inhibited by binding inhibitors such as pyrano-dipyrimides. \\n2. 3’ Processing. The integrase removes a dinucleotide at each end of the viral DNA\\nproducing new 3’ hydroxyl ends within the PIC. This step can be inhibited by \\n3’ processing inhibitors such as diketo acids. \\n3. Strand transfer . After the transport of the PIC from the cytoplasm through a\\nnuclear pore into the cell’s nucleus, integrase binds to the host chromosomal DNA.\\nBy doing this, integrase mediates irreversible binding of viral and cellular DNA.\\nThis step can be inhibited by integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). All avail-\\nable integrase inhibitors are INSTIs. \\n4. Gap repair. The combination of viral and cellular DNA is a gapped intermediate\\nproduct. The gap repair is done by host cell DNA repair enzymes. Integrase seems\\nnot to be necessary in this last step, which can be inhibited by gap repair inhibitors\\nsuch as methylxanthines. \\nFor almost a decade, the development of integrase inhibitors was slow. This was\\nlargely because of a lack of good lead compounds and reliable in vitroscreening assays\\nthat incorporate each of the integration steps (Lataillade 2006). Only after 2000 did\\ndevelopment progress and the principle of strand transfer was elucidated (Hazuda\\n2000). Since 2005, numerous clinical studies have evaluated integrase inhibitors\\n(mainly strand transfer inhibitors). In December 2007, raltegravir was licensed as the\\nfirst integrase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV+ patients. Today, three integrase\\ninhibitors are on the market, namely raltegravir, elvitegravir and dolutegravir. Given\\nthe good tolerability and the high potency of this drug class, INSTIs now play a major\\nrole in HIV medicine. \\nAs with other antiretroviral drug classes, however, some questions remain unan-\\nswered. Although very well-tolerated during the first years of therapy, little is known\\nabout long-term toxicity of integrase inhibitors. There is no experience with long-\\nterm use beyond 5–10 years. Genetic resistance barriers, relatively low with ralte-\\ngravir and elvitegravir, may also be an important issue. Increased viral rebound rates\\nwere observed with treatment-experienced patients on boosted PIs (viral load below\\nthe limit of detection) when switching to raltegravir, especially in those with pre-\\nexisting resistance (Eron 2009). There is also some evidence for cross-resistance. As\\nsoon as integrase inhibitor resistance develops, the agent should be stopped. This\\nway, further resistance mutations (Wirden 2009) can be avoided, as well as unnec-\\nessary costs. Problems also exist with the measurement of plasma levels (Cattaneo 2012).\\nIndividual agents \\nDolutegravir (DTG, Tivicay®, also part of Triumeq®) is an integrase inhibitor that\\ninitially emerged via Shionogi cooperating with GSK and is now being developed by\\nViiV Healthcare. As a second-generation integrase inhibitor it shows improvements,\\n100 ART'),\n",

In a Phase IIa study with 35\\npatients, a reduction of 2.5 logs was observed and 7/10 achieved a viral load below\\n50 copies/ml during 10 days monotherapy (Min 2011). \\nART-naïve patients: after the encouraging results of SPRING-1, a Phase IIb study\\n(Stellbrink 2012), dolutegravir was tested against its competitor drug, the first-in-\\nclass INSTI raltegravir. In SPRING-2, 822 patients received two NRTIs and either 50 mg\\nQD or raltegravir 400 mg BID. At 96 weels, 81% versus 76% had achieved an unde-\\ntectable viral load, respectively. Thus, non-inferiority to raltegravir was shown. In\\ncases with virological failure, less resistance mutations were observed (Raffi 2013).\\nIn SINGLE, another double-blinded, randomized Phase III study on 833 previously\\nuntreated patients, the fixed-dose combination with dolutegravir and ABC+3TC\\n(available as Triumeq\\n®) was superior to Atripla®. However, a relatively large number\\nof patients had discontinued Atripla ® due to CNS toxicity (Walmsley 2013).\\nDolutegravir also performed very well in the FLAMINGO trial in which it was tested\\nagainst darunavir (Clotet 2014). No resistance mutations were observed in cases of\\ntherapy failure.\\nTreatment-experienced patients: In SAILING, a randomised, double-blind, non-inferi-\\nority study in 715 patients with a detectable viral load and with resistance to two or\\nmore classes of antiretroviral drugs, 50 mg dolutegravir QD were well tolerated with\\ngreater virological effect compared with 400 mg raltegravir BID. At 24 weeks, 79%\\nversus 70% of the patients had achieved an undetectable viral load. Of note,\\n significantly fewer patients had virological failure with treatment-emergent  integrase-\\ninhibitor resistance than on raltegravir (Cahn 2013). Even in the setting of INSTI\\nresistance mutations, dolutegravir retains its efficacy. Preliminary data from the VIKING\\nstudy showed that a higher dosage (50 mg BID instead of 50 mg OD) may help over-\\ncome raltegravir resistance (Eron 2013, Castagna 2014). Tolerance was excellent and\\nbetter than with efavirenz, showing only a slight increase in creatine levels, which\\nseems not to be significant and is caused by inhibition of a renal transporter system. \\nThe resistance barrier is possibly higher than with other integrase inhibitors, prob-\\nably due to prolonged binding with integrase complexes (Hightower 2011). Cross-\\nresistance with other integrase inhibitors does not seem obligatory (Kobayashi 2011).\\nAn important resistance mutation appears at T124A, as well as mutations typical for\\nraltegravir at codon 148. Efficacy seems to decline with Q148V and additional muta-\\ntions (Canducci 2011, Garrido 2011, Castagna 2014).\\nThere are no interactions with boosted PIs. However, etravirine reduces the levels of\\ndolutegravir significantly (Song 2011). This also applies for antacids and it is rec-\\nommended not to administer them simultaneously (Patel 2011). When rifampicin\\nis given, a higher dose of dolutegravir seems necessary (Dooley 2012). Fortunately,\\nthere is no effect of food intake on resorption (Song 2012).\\nSince its approval in 2014, dolutegravir has rapidly gained an important role in HIV\\nmedicine. Good tolerability, high resistance barrier, once-daily dosing and the\\nabsence of any booster requirements are major advantages. The coformulation with\\nABC+3TC, the first STR without tenofovir, is also very attractive.\\nElvitegravir (ELV, Vitekta\\n®, also part of Stribild®) is an integrase strand transfer\\ninhibitor developed by Gilead, with a biochemical similarity to chinolone antibi-\\notics (Sato 2006). In a study with 40 patients (ART-naïve and pre-treated), viral load\\ndecreased by 2 logs at 10 days of monotherapy (DeJesus 2006). In pre-treated patients\\nthere was a good effect when compared to a boosted PI (Zolopa 2010). A disadvan-\\ntage is that elvitegravir must be boosted (Kearney 2006), but on the other hand a\\nsingle administration per day seems possible. \\n6.2. Overview of antiretroviral agents    101'),\n",

Stribild ®,\\na fixed-dose combination of the four Gilead substances tenofovir, FTC, cobicistat\\nand elvitegravir in a single tablet, showed good efficacy in a phase II trial on therapy-\\nnaïve patients (Cohen 2011). Two large phase III trials investigating QUAD on\\ntherapy-naïve patients led to the approval of Stribild\\n®. In 236-0102, 700 patients\\nreceived either Stribild®, or Atripla® (Sax 2012) and in 236-0103, 708 patients were\\ntreated with either Stribild® or TDF+FTC+atazanavir/r (DeJesus 2012). After 48 weeks,\\n88% under Stribild ® (versus 84%) and 90% (versus 87%), respectively, achieved a\\nviral load below 50 copies/ml. Both trials showed no difference in subgroups (sex,\\nage, CD4 T-cell count, amount of viral load). Tolerance was good, except for more\\ncases of nausea (21 versus 14%) under elvitegravir. In contrast, fewer cases of dizzi-\\nness (7 versus 24%) and dyslipidemia were observed. The results were sustained over\\na period of 144 weeks (Clumeck 2014, Wohl 2014). \\nThere are, however, some problems with nephrotoxicity. Cobicistat inhibits renal\\ntubular secretion of creatinine and increases serum creatinine levels, resulting in a\\ndecrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) without a true decline in GFR.\\nThus, it may difficult to distinguish between these effects and the “true” renal  toxicity\\nof tenofovir. In the phase III studies, the GFR declined by 13–14 mL/min. There are\\ndetailed recommendations for renal monitoring during therapy with Stribild\\n®. In all\\npatients, document estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl), urine glucose, and urine\\nprotein should be available at baseline. Stribild\\n® should not be initiated or discon-\\ntinued when estimated CrCl is <70 or <50 mL/min, respectively. \\nIn 145, a large randomized double-blind Phase III trial on over 700 pre-treated patients\\nwith documented resistance showed similar effects with elvitegravir or raltegravir\\n(Elion 2012). Consequently, Stribild\\n® can also be used in treatment-experienced\\npatients without known resistance mutations to INSTIs. The switch from PIs or\\nNNRTIs in patients with sustained virological suppression (and very limited resist-\\nance) is also possible, as shown by two large randomized trials (Arribas 2014, Pozniak\\n2014). It remains to be seen if Stribild\\n® is also potent in heavily pretreated patients. \\nThere seems to be at least two resistance pathways, located at the codons T66I or\\nE92Q (Shimura 2008). Especially E92Q induces a high resistance. In the case of Y143,\\na raltegravir resistance, efficacy seems to persist (Métifiot 2011). Resistance muta-\\ntions of elvitegravir and raltegravir overlap to a great extent (Garrido 2012). No viro-\\nlogic response was observed in a small clinical study with patients who switched\\nfrom elvitegravir to raltegravir (DeJesus 2007).\\nMajor interactions with elvitegravir are not expected, at least not with NRTIs,\\ndarunavir, tipranavir, fosamprenavir or etravirine. However, dose adjustments with\\nlopinavir/r and atazanavir/r may be necessary. The dose of maraviroc must be halved\\n(Ramanathan 2011). There are no clinically relevant interactions between boosted\\nelvitegravir and H2-receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors. However,\\n staggered antacid administration by 2 hours is recommended (Ramanathan 2013)\\nIn September 2014, elvitegravir as single agent was approved for use with a protease\\ninhibitor coadministered with ritonavir plus other antiretrovirals. The approval was\\nbased upon results from the Phase III Study 145 (see above). \\nRaltegravir (RAL, Isentress\\n®) is a strand transfer inhibitor and was the first integrase\\ninhibitor on the market (Hazuda 2000). Raltegravir has a wide range of efficacy for\\nR5 and X4 tropic viruses, and inhibits HIV-2 replication. During a 10-day\\n monotherapy, viral load declined by two logs (Markowitz 2006). \\nThe encouraging results of an early Phase II study in extensively pre-treated patients\\n(Grinsztejn 2007) were confirmed by two large Phase III studies which led to approval\\nof raltegravir.

Even in\\npatients initially without an active substance in their background therapy in geno-\\ntypic assays, the success rate reached 57% (versus 10%). The effects were sustained\\nbeyond 144 weeks (Eron 2010). \\nRaltegravir has also been effective in treatment-naïve patients. The encouraging data\\nfrom an early Phase II study (Markowitz 2009) were confirmed by a large Phase III\\nstudy in which 563 patients received either raltegravir or efavirenz (Lennox 2009):\\nat week 48, rates of patients achieving undetectable plasma viremia (<50 copies/ml)\\nwere 86% and 82%, respectively. Tolerability was better and the effects were main-\\ntained over five years (Rockstroh 2013). In September 2009, raltegravir was approved\\nfor first-line therapy. In ACTG 5237, raltegravir was superior to the two boosted PIs\\natazanavir and darunavir (Landovitz 2014).\\nTolerability of raltegravir has so far been excellent. In BENCHMRK, raltegravir side\\neffects were comparable to placebo. Apart from some anecdotal reports of rhab-\\ndomyolysis, hepatitis, rash and insomnia (Gray 2009, Santos 2009, Dori 2010,\\nTsukada 2010), frequently appearing side effects with raltegravir have not been seen.\\nRaltegravir seems to be safe, including in those with hepatitis coinfections (Rockstroh\\n2012). In patients with renal impairment, no dosage adjustment is required. Expected\\nautoimmune diseases observed in animal testing have so far not been clinically\\n confirmed (Beck-Engeser 2010). There is limited data for pediatric or pregnant\\npatients (Taylor 2011). Due to its excellent tolerability, raltegravir is currently being\\nevaluated in the setting of nuke-sparing strategies (see below).\\nThe fact that viral load decreased more rapidly in the first weeks in patients taking\\nraltegravir compared to those taking efavirenz led to some speculations about higher\\npotency (Murray 2007). Several experimental studies looked at strategies aimed at\\nachieving viral eradication with raltegravir intensification (see chapter on\\nEradication). However, some experts believe that the faster response on raltegravir-\\nbased regimens is not a matter of potency, but rather due to its unique effect of block-\\ning integration of the HIV genome (Siliciano 2009).\\nWhat is known about resistance to raltegravir? There are at least two common resist-\\nance pathways, via mutations Q148K/R/H or N155H. Both mutations are localized\\nwithin the catalytic core of the integrase (Grinsztejn 2007, Malet 2008). A third\\npathway seems to be Y143 (Delelis 2010). Resistance may occur quickly on a failing\\nregimen (Grinsztejin 2007, Taiwo 2011). The resistance barrier of raltegravir seems\\nnot very high although it is higher than that for NNRTIs. A few days of monother-\\napy are not enough to select resistance mutations as is the case with nevirapine\\n(Miller 2010). There is evidence for cross-resistance with elvitegravir (DeJesus 2007,\\nGarrido 2012). Transmission of raltegravir-associated resistance mutations has been\\nreported (Boyd 2011, Young 2011). \\nSwitching to raltegravir is not always safe. This was shown by the randomized\\nSWITCHMRK studies (Eron 2010) with more than 700 patients on a lopinavir/r-based\\nART with a viral load below 50 copies/ml for at least three months. Switching to ral-\\ntegravir showed a better lipid profile, but did not demonstrate non-inferiority with\\nrespect to HIV RNA <50 copies/ml at week 24 versus remaining on lopinavir/r. In\\ntotal, 6% of the patients showed a viral rebound. Again, these results provide evi-\\ndence for a possibly lower resistance barrier of integrase inhibitors compared to\\nboosted PIs. Even if the smaller Spanish SPIRAL study did not confirm these results\\n(Martinez 2010), switching from boosted PIs to other agents should be considered\\nwith care. Switching from T-20 to raltegravir, however, is probably safe (De Castro\\n2009, Grant 2009, Gallien 2011). \\n6.2. Overview of antiretroviral agents    103'),\n",

Binding or attachment of HIV to the CD4 receptor (target of attachment inhibitors),\\n2. Binding to co-receptors (target of co-receptor antagonists), \\n3. Fusion of virus and cell (target of fusion inhibitors).\\nEvery step of HIV entry can theoretically be inhibited. Step 1 is inhibited by attach-\\nment-inhibitors, step 2 by co-receptor antagonists and step 3 by fusion inhibitors.\\nAll three drug classes are currently called entry inhibitors. One important difference\\nto other drug classes is that entry inhibitors do not inhibit HIV intracellularly. They\\ninterfere early in the replication cycle of HIV. It is speculated that this will lead to a\\nbetter tolerability of this class.\\nIn 2003 T-20 was licensed as the first entry inhibitor in Europe and the US. In 2007,\\nmaraviroc was the first CCR5 co-receptor antagonist and the first oral entry inhibitor.\\nNumerous other drugs are in the pipeline, but will not be available soon. T-20 and\\nmaraviroc will be discussed in this section, for other entry inhibitors, including\\nattachment inhibitors, refer to the next chapter, ART 2017/2018.\\nCo-receptor antagonists\\nPreface\\nIn addition to CD4 receptors, HIV requires so-called co-receptors to enter the target\\ncell. The two most important ones, CXCR4 and CCR5, were discovered in the mid-\\n1990s (Alkhatib 1996, Deng 1996, Doranz 1996). These receptors, of which there are\\nprobably more than 200 in total, are named after the natural chemokines that usually\\nbind to them. Their nomenclature is derived from the amino acid sequence. For\\nCCR5 receptors these are the CC chemokine MIP and RANTES, for CXCR4 receptors\\nit is the CXC chemokine SDF-1.\\nHIV variants use either the CCR5 or the CXCR4 receptors for entry into the target\\ncell. HIV variants are termed R5-tropic if they use CCR5 as a co-receptor, whereas\\nviruses with a preference for CXCR4 are termed X4-tropic viruses. R5 viruses pre-\\ndominantly infect macrophages (formerly, M-tropic). X4 viruses mainly infect T cells\\n(formerly, T-tropic). Dual-tropic viruses are able to use both receptors. There also\\nexist mixed populations of R5 and X4 viruses. In most patients, R5 viruses are found\\nin the early stages of infection. X4 viruses, which are probably able to infect a wider\\nspectrum of cell types, usually occur in the later stages of disease. In addition, X4\\nviruses almost always occur in X4/R5-mixed populations and an exclusive X4 virus\\n6.2.

The change in tropism is frequently associated with disease\\nprogression (Connor 1997, Scarlatti 1997). \\nIt is still not completely clear why this happens after several years of infection,\\nalthough the tropism shift only needs a few small mutations. However, it is  possible\\nthat X4 viruses are significantly more virulent, but because of their low glycosyla-\\ntion, more immunogenic. X4 viruses are neutralized better by the immune system\\nand it is therefore likely that they only become apparent in the presence of a\\n significant immune deficiency. \\nIn some individuals expression of CCR5 co-receptors on the cell surface is reduced.\\nThese individuals are usually healthy. The reduced expression of the receptor is\\nusually due to a defective CCR5 allele that contains an internal 32-base pair dele-\\ntion (/H900432 deletion). This deletion appears to protect homozygous individuals from\\nsexual transmission of HIV-1. If infected, these individuals have a slower decrease in\\ntheir CD4 T cell count and a longer AIDS-free survival than individuals with the wild\\ntype gene (Dean 1996, Liu 1996, Samson 1996). In healthy individuals, there is no\\nstrong evidence for any illness associated with the deletion. Thus, targeting the inter-\\naction between HIV-1 and the CCR-5 receptor appears to be an attractive therapeu-\\ntic goal to prevent or slow disease progression.\\nIn 2008 the case of a person (the “Berlin” patient) with acute myeloid leukemia and\\nHIV-1 infection was published. This patient underwent stem cell transplantation\\nfrom a donor who was homozygous for the CCR5 /H900432 deletion. The patient has\\nremained without viral rebound for more than five years after transplantation and\\ndiscontinuation of ART. This outcome demonstrates the critical role CCR5 plays in\\nmaintaining HIV-1 infection (Hütter 2009, Allers 2011).\\nIn treatment-naïve patients, R5 strains are found in 80–90%, compared to only 50–\\n55% in patients with antiretroviral exposure (Hoffmann 2007). The most important\\npredictor of R5 tropism seems to be a higher CD4 T cell count in both naïve and\\nantiretrovirally-pretreated patients. A low HIV plasma viremia seems to be associ-\\nated with R5 tropism only in untreated patients (Moyle 2005, Brumme 2005). In\\ncontrast, X4 viruses are almost exclusively found in advanced stages of the disease.\\nWhen the CD4 T cell count is >500/µl, they are only found in 6%; at <25 CD4 \\nT cells/µl, in more than 50% of patients (Brumme 2005). \\nCCR5 antagonists probably need be given earlier in the course of disease. In the\\nsalvage situation, patients often harbor X4 viruses. The role of CCR5 antagonists\\nmight lie rather in the substitution of other antiretroviral agents in case of toxicity. \\nTesting for co-receptor usage (Tropism testing) \\nSince CCR5 blockers are effective only when a predominant R5 virus is present in\\nthe patient and co-receptor switch is not systematic, a baseline determination of the\\nco-receptor usage of the virus is mandatory. Tropism testing prior to treatment avoids\\nunnecessary costs and additional risks for the patient. Non-effectivity of CCR5 antag-\\nonists may cause regimen frailty and lead to resistance. This is why the development\\nof CCR5 antagonists has brought along a completely new laboratory branch which\\nfocuses on predicting the co-receptors mainly or exclusively used by viral popula-\\ntion (see the chapter on Resistance).\\nSeveral commercial assays have been developed to determine HIV tropism pheno-\\ntypically, such as Trofile\\n® (Monogram Biosciences). These assays are complex, time-\\nconsuming and require a viral load of at least 500–1,000 copies. A new version of\\nthe assay, Trofile-ES\\n®, can detect smaller numbers of X4 virus (ES, enhanced sensi-\\ntivity), resistant to CCR5 inhibitors, when they constitute a minor subpopulation.\\nSeveral studies have illustrated the potential benefit of the use of the newer, more\\nsensitive tests (Saag 2008, Su 2008). \\n108 ART'),\n",

Genotypic tropism testing has been validated by several studies and\\nhas now substituted the more complex and expensive phenotypic assay (Sierra 2007,\\nPoveda 2009, Swenson 2011). Presently the focus of research is on the V3 loop of\\nthe envelope protein gp120, as this is the region where HIV binds to the co-recep-\\ntor (Jensen 2003, Briz 2006). However, tropism does not only seem to be defined by\\nthe V3 loop sequence – viral isolates with identical V3 loops can differ in tropism\\n(Huang 2006, Low 2007).\\nWith genotypic testing, CCR5 antagonists may be suitable for many patients who\\nhave side effects on other agents, as long as the viral load is well suppressed. As\\n mentioned above, phenotypic testing requires a viral load of at least 1000 copies/ml,\\nwhereas genotypic testing is possible with proviral DNA – even patients with an\\nundetectable RNA in the plasma can be tested. Clinical studies have shown that this\\nis possible and effective (Soulie 2009, Bellecave 2012). CCR5 antagonists may there-\\nfore be able to replace other drugs in the setting of a fully suppressed virus (i.e. in\\nthe context of side effects). \\nTropism shift and other consequences \\nDuring treatment failure of antiretroviral regimens containing CCR5 antagonists,\\nmany patients often show a selection shift to X4 viruses. This shift is mainly due to\\nselections from preexisting pools (Westba 2006). In a pilot study in which patients\\nwith X4/R5 mixed populations received maraviroc, CD4 T cells were higher in\\n comparison to placebo (Saag 2009). An X4 shift (induced HIV progression) while on\\nCCR5 antagonists therefore seems very unlikely.\\nWhat other consequences could a CCR5 blockade have? Although individuals with\\na /H900432 gene defect for the CCR5 receptor are usually healthy, there are worries about\\nnegative effects of blocking these receptors, i.e., this chemokine receptor must exist\\nfor some reason. Individuals with the /H900432 deletion have been examined in numer-\\nous studies to see if they suffer more frequently from illnesses compared to patients\\nwithout this gene defect. An increased appearance of West Nile viral infection (Glass\\n2006) or FSME (Kindberg 2008) was greatly discussed, whereas the /H900432 deletion seems\\nto be protective for rheumatism (Prahalad 2006). However, a recently published ran-\\ndomized trial did not show a beneficial effect of maraviroc in rheumatoid arthritis\\n(Fleishaker 2012). \\n6.2.

However, it is advisable to monitor\\ncarefully, as experience with CCR5 antagonists has so far been limited. Moreover, in\\ntheory, docking onto the receptor could cause an autoimmune reaction. However,\\nthis has not occurred in testing with monkeys (Peters 2005). Negative effects towards\\nvaccinations have also bee discussed (Roukens 2009). An analysis of the complete\\nPhase I/II studies with maraviroc has shown no negative effects on immune func-\\ntion (Ayoub 2007). The initially disquieting report of malignancies in a study with\\nvicriviroc (Gulick 2007) has not been confirmed in any following studies.\\nImmune modulation with CCR5 antagonists?\\nEarly observations led to the supposition that CCR5 antagonists may be able to serve\\nas immune modulators. Effects of an additional dosage in patients with poor immune\\nconstitution have not shown the results hoped for in studies so far (Lanzafame 2009,\\nStepanyuk 2009, Hunt 2011). A meta-analysis found no evidence for a beneficial\\neffect of maraviroc on immune reconstitution (Pichenot 2012). However, there are\\nindications of positive effects on immune activation (Funderberg 2009, Wilkin\\n2010+2011) and latent viral reservoir (Gutiérrez 2010). There is little experience\\noutside experimental studies and the results are not yet confirmed.\\nIndividual agents (for unlicensed agents, see next chapter)\\nMaraviroc (MVC, Celsentri® or Selzentry®) from ViiV Healthcare was the first drug\\nin its class to be licensed for the treatment of HIV infection in September 2007.\\nMaraviroc allosterically binds to CCR5. This means that it does not bind directly to\\nthe receptor but induces conformational changes within CCR5 that result in the\\ninhibition of its binding to viral gp120 (see Figure 2.3). During maraviroc monother-\\napy, viral load declines by 1.6 logs after 10–15 days (Fätkenheuer 2005). \\nTwo almost identical Phase III studies led to approval of the drug, MOTIVATE-1 (US,\\nCanada) and -2 (Europe, Australia, US). A total of 1,049 treatment-experienced\\npatients with R5 virus were enrolled (Gulick 2008, Fätkenheuer 2008). Patients had\\nbeen treated with or had resistance to three antiretroviral drug classes and had a\\nbaseline viral load of more than 5,000 copies/ml. Patients were randomly assigned\\nto one of three antiretroviral regimens consisting of maraviroc once-daily,  maraviroc\\nBID or placebo, each of which included OBT – agents such as darunavir, etravirine\\nor raltegravir were not allowed. At 48 weeks in both studies more patients in the\\nmaraviroc arms were below 50 copies/ml (46% and 43% versus 17% with placebo).\\nA treatment benefit of maraviroc over placebo was also shown in patients with a\\nhigh viral load and multiple resistance mutations (Fätkenheuer 2008). Results\\nremained the same after 96 weeks (Hardy 2010). Tolerability of maraviroc was excel-\\nlent and did not differ from that of placebo. In addition, the shift to X4 viruses in\\nthose with no virological success had no negative effects.\\nMaraviroc has also been tested in treatment-naïve patients (Cooper 2010, Sierra-\\nMadero 2010). In the MERIT study, a total of 721 patients randomly received\\nAZT+3TC plus either efavirenz or maraviroc BID (the arm with maraviroc QD was\\nprematurely closed due to lower efficacy). Virological failure was more frequent on\\nmaraviroc (11.9% versus 4.2%). Although the CD4 T cell increases were significantly\\nmore pronounced on maraviroc, the study failed to show non-inferiority of mar-\\naviroc compared to efavirenz. Of note, there were significant differences seen between\\nstudy populations in the northern versus southern hemisphere in this worldwide\\ntrial. Response rates proved almost equal in northern hemisphere countries, but not\\nas good south of the equator. In addition, a retrospective analysis revealed that at\\nleast 4% of the patients in the maraviroc arm had experienced a tropism shift from\\n110 ART'),\n",

In these patients with dual\\ntropic virus, response rates were very poor. Would a better and more sensitive test\\nhave been able to demonstrate a more relevant difference between maraviroc and\\nefavirenz? A retrospective analysis using the enhanced Trofile assay, in which no\\n differences were observed, seems to back this argument (Cooper 2010, Swenson 2011,\\nMcGovern 2013). On the basis of this data the FDA extended the license for  maraviroc\\nto therapy-naïve patients in November 2009. However, the available data was not\\nsufficient for EMA to permit such an extension in indication. Unfortunately, the\\nexperimental strategy of nuke sparing, i.e. maraviroc plus darunavir/r was also not\\nas effective that standard therapy (Stellbrink 2014). \\nMaraviroc’s tolerability is excellent over five years (Gulick 2014). In the MERIT study,\\nthe discontinuation rates due to adverse events were significantly lower than with\\nefavirenz (4.2% vs 13.6%) and lipid profiles were better (MacInnes 2011). There seems\\nto be no liver toxicity as seen with aplaviroc, a CCR5 antagonist whose development\\nwas halted in 2005, not even in those with existing liver damage (Abel 2009).\\nWhat about the efficacy of maraviroc in the presence of non-R5 viruses? In a double-\\nblind randomized Phase II study on 113 patients the effect was, as expected,\\n moderate. There was no antiviral effect compared to placebo. However, CD4 T cells\\nimproved significantly in those on maraviroc despite the lack of virologic efficacy\\n(Saag 2009). \\nWith regard to resistance, only limited data exist to date. Mutations in the gene\\nregions coding for the V3 loop of the envelope protein gp120 may lead to complete\\nresistance to maraviroc. This may occur by de novo acquisition of mutations allow-\\ning the virus to use the CXCR4 receptor or via “true” resistance. The latter may occur\\nin viral isolates that remain R5 tropic. A shift to X4 tropism is not necessary as resist-\\nance may happen via an increased affinity of the viral envelope for unbound CCR5\\nmolecules or through an ability of the viral envelope to use compound-occupied\\nreceptors for entry (Westby 2007, Lewis 2008). It seems that the resistance barrier\\nfor true maraviroc resistance in R5 viruses is high (Jubb 2009).\\nIn practice it is important that the recommended dosage of maraviroc is adjusted\\ndepending on the concomitant therapy (Abel 2005). With boosted PIs (except for\\ntipranavir) the usual dosage of 2x300 mg is halved, while with efavirenz (or other\\nenzyme inducers such as rifampicin or carbamazepin) it is doubled. No adjustment\\nis required with raltegravir (Andrews 2010).\\nDespite excellent tolerance, application of maraviroc still remains relatively limited,\\nas obstacles such as requirement for tropism testing, restricted indication (in Europe)\\nand slightly complicated dosage still stands in the way: Unfortunately, nuke-sparing\\nstrategies with maraviroc were not successful (see Nuke-Sparing). \\nReferences \\nAbel S, Davis JD, Ridgway CE, Hamlin JC, Vourvahis M.

The fusion\\nof virus and cell is complex and not completely understood. Simplified, it seems that\\nbinding to the CD4 and to the co-receptor induces conformational changes in the\\ngp41, the transmembrane subunit of the viral envelope protein. In the course of\\nthese rearrangements, the N-terminal fusion peptide of gp41 translocates and inserts\\ninto the target cell membrane. A proposed extended conformation of the gp41\\nectodomain, with its fusion peptide thus inserted and the transmembrane anchor\\nstill in the viral membrane, has been called the “pre-hairpin intermediate”.

Antiviral activ-\\nity was dose-dependent, and at the higher dose of 100 mg BID, the viral load was\\nreduced by almost 2 logs (Kilby 1998+2002). In early studies of the subcutaneous\\napplication, an effect on viral load was still evident in one third of patients after 48\\nweeks. \\nTwo Phase III studies led to the licensing of T-20. TORO 1 (T-20 versus Optimized\\nRegimen Only) enrolled 491 extensively pretreated patients in North America and\\nBrazil, most with multiresistant viruses. In TORO 2, 504 patients in Europe and\\nAustralia were enrolled. Patients in both studies on an optimized ART regimen either\\nreceived 90 mg T-20 BID subcutaneously or none at all (Lalezari 2003, Lazzarin 2003).\\nIn TORO-1, the reduction in viral load was 0.94 logs better with T-20 than optimized\\ntherapy without T-20. In TORO-2 this difference was 0.78 logs (Nelson 2005). A\\nstrong impact on viral load was also seen with tipranavir, darunavir, maraviroc or\\nraltegravir. In all large studies evaluating these agents (RESIST, POWER, MOTIVATE,\\nBENCHMRK), the additional use of T-20 was of significant benefit. If at least two\\nactive substances are not available, the option of T-20 should be discussed with the\\npatient. Small pilot studies such as INTENSE or INDEED suggest that T-20, given as\\n“induction”, i.e., in the first weeks of a new salvage therapy, lowers the viral load\\nmore rapidly (Reynes 2007, Clotet 2008). \\nThe success of T-20 therapy should be monitored early on, particularly in view of\\nthe cost. Patients without a decrease in viral load of at least one log after 8-12 weeks\\nwill not benefit and can be spared the required twice-daily injections. It is also not\\nrecommended to inject the full daily dose of T-20 once a day: although 180 mg QD\\nhas the same bioequivalence (as measured by AUC) to the standard 90 mg BID, at\\nleast one study has shown a trend towards a smaller decrease in viral load with the\\nQD dose that was clearly associated with lower trough levels (Thompson 2006).\\nOne observation in the TORO studies was the increased frequency of lym-\\nphadenopathy and bacterial pneumonia in those on T-20 (6.7/100 versus 0.6/100\\npatient years) (Trottier 2005). Septicemia also occurred more often on T-20, but the\\ndifference was not significant. The reason for the increased rate of infections remains\\nunclear, but binding of T-20 to granulocytes has been suspected. Substantial side\\neffects remain constant (98% in the TORO studies), and over the course of therapy,\\nsevere local skin reactions occur at the injection site. These can be particularly painful\\nand can result in interruption of therapy: 4.4% of cases in the TORO studies. In our\\nexperience of everyday clinical treatment, therapy is interrupted frequently due to\\nthese skin problems (see section on Side Effects). Unfortunately the development of\\na bio-injection system in which T-20 is pressed into the skin was halted.\\nResistance mutations develop relatively rapidly on T-20, but seem to reduce viral\\nfitness (Lu 2002, Menzo 2004). Receptor tropism of the virus seems to be not\\n significantly affected. There are some changes to a short sequence on the gp41 gene,\\ncausing reduced susceptibility to T-20, which is due to simple point mutations (Mink\\n2005). In contrast, viruses resistant to NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIs are susceptible to T-20\\n(Greenberg 2003). As it is a relatively large peptide, it induces antibody production.\\nThis does not seem to impair efficacy (Walmsley 2003). More disturbing is the fact\\nthat in a large TDM study there was a very large interpatient variability and extremely\\nlow plasma levels were often found (Stocker 2006). \\nIn summary, patients with a well-controlled viral load or who still have options with\\nclassical ART do not require T-20. For salvage therapy the drug seems to be very\\n valuable in individual cases. However, T-20 probably has only a minor role to play\\nin the future of HIV treatment. Many patients have already successfully replaced \\nT-20 with newer oral antiretrovirals like raltegravir (DeCastro 2009, Grant 2009,\\nSantos 2009, Talbot 2009, Gallien 2011). \\n114 ART'),\n",

ART 2017/2018: The horizon and beyond\\nCHRISTIAN HOFFMANN\\nAlmost all HIV+ patients can now be treated with a virologically successful regimen,\\neven those with multiple resistance mutations. There are very few “untreatable”\\npatients. However, despite this considerable progress, there is an urgent need for new\\ndrugs. This is not just true for patients with multiresistant viruses awaiting new treat-\\nment options. Significant problems related to long-term toxicity and adherence are\\nanticipated for all therapies that will presumably need to span decades, as eradica-\\ntion of HIV is still out of reach for the majority of the patients. A recent study has\\ndemonstrated that the median time until exhaustion of currently available treat-\\nment options is 45 years. Of note, 10% of HIV+ patients are expected to exhaust all\\ncurrently available ART options after just 26 years (Jansson 2013). As a result, new\\ndrugs are needed that are easier to take, with high genetic barriers to development\\nof resistance, and above all less toxic. To reach the goal of eradication, new drugs\\nneed to be more potent than those available today. The following overview of agents\\nthat could make it to the clinic based on current data (mid-2015) does not claim to\\nbe complete.\\nNew pharmacoenhancers (PKEs) \\nMany antiretroviral agents, among them almost all PIs, but also the integrase inhi-\\nbotor elvitegravir, have to be boosted in order to enhance their pharmacokinetics.\\nFor more than a decade, ritonavir has been the only reliable option for boosting. In\\nthe meantime, cobicistat has been introduced to the market. The advantages of these\\nnew agents inhibiting the CYP3A system is that they have no antiviral effect and\\nthus would not cause resistance. \\nSPI-452 is a PKE developed by Sequoia (Gulik 2009). In a first clinical study, differ-\\nent doses were given to 58 healthy volunteers. Tolerance was good. The levels of\\ndarunavir (37-fold) and atazanavir (13-fold) significantly increased. The booster effect\\nlasted for a long time. Sequioa may continue research with SPI-452 as an individual\\nagent and in fixed combinations. Their website recently closed down. Further devel-\\nopment is questionable.\\nPF-03716539 is a PKE from Pfizer. Studies with healthy volunteers regarding its effects\\non midazolam, maraviroc and darunavir were concluded in 2009 according to clin-\\ncaltrials.gov. The results have not yet been officially released. The product is not\\nlisted on either the Pfizer or the ViiV websites. \\nTMC-558445 manufactured by Tibotec pharmaceuticals was tested in a Phase I dose\\nescalation study. Results are not available. Janssen, the current official name of the\\ncompany, does not have PKEs on their short-list of priorities for the future.\\nLong-Acting Drugs, New formulations, Generics \\nCurrently available drugs continue to be developed, the most important goals being\\na reduction in pill burden, easier dosing and fewer side effects. In addition, long-\\nacting drugs are under development. These nanoformulated agents can be given\\nmuch less frequently (i.e., an injection intramuscular every 1–3 months). They may\\nbe helpful in improving adherence but also in the setting of preexposure prophy-\\nlaxis. In an early study, many patients indicated that they definitely or probably\\nwould try parenteral nanoformulated antiretroviral therapy (Williams 2013).\\nDifferent techniques are in development (Guo 2014).\\n116 ART'),\n",

In animals monthly injections were highly protective as PrEP\\n(Andrews 2014, Radzio 2014). When given as a monotherapy in HIV+ patients,\\nplasma viremia declined by 2.2–2.3 logs (Spreen 2013). The resistance barrier seems\\nto be as high as that of dolutegravir. Given orally, cabotegravir is also very effective.\\nIn the LATTE-1 study, different dosages were evaluated in 243 ART-naive patients\\nand compared with efavirenz (Margolis 2014). After an induction period during that\\ncabotegravir and efavirenz were combined each with 2 NRTIs, patients remained on\\nefavirenz or switched to 10–60 mg cabotegravir plus the NNRTI rilpivirine. At 48\\nweeks, the rates of patients with an undetectable viral load were 82% in the experi-\\nmental arms with cabotegravir plus rilpivirine, compared to 71% with the standard\\nregime of efavirenz plus 2 NRTIs. Only a few resistance mutations were observed.\\nThese early esults support the selected dose regimens for the ongoing LATTE-2 study\\nwith cabotegravir LA + rilpivirine LA as injectable two-drug maintenance therapy.\\nRilpivirin LA – is a parenteral formulation enabling prolonged prolonged plasma\\nand genital-tract exposure (Jackson 2013). In one study, a single injection yielded to\\nmeasurable concentrations in plasma and genital fluids even after 84 days postdose\\n(Else 2012, Jackson 2013) making this an attractive approach for PrEP. With monthly\\nintramuscular injections, similar levels can be achived as with daily oral dosing of\\n25 mg. As mentioned above, rilpivirine is currently tested in combination with\\ncabotegravir as injectable two-drug maintenance therapy. There are no relevant inter-\\nactions (Ford 2014).\\nAtazanavir LA – was tested in mice. It had translational potential with sustained\\nand targeted efficacy and with limited systemic toxicities. Folate coating of nano\\nART with atazanavir/r significantly enhanced cell uptake, retention and antiretrovi-\\nral activities without altering cell viability (Dash 2012, Puligijja 2013).\\nGenerics have been produced by companies from Africa, India, Brazil or Thailand\\n(see Chapter on Global Access). In developing countries many new and previously\\nunkown fixed drug combinations (FDC) are used. The most frequently used FDC is\\nd4T+3TC+nevirapine that exists as Triomune (Cipla), GPO-vir (GPO), Triviro LNS\\n(Ranbaxy) or Nevilast (Genixpharma). In most cases, bioequivalence has been\\ndemonstrated (Laurent 2004, Marier 2007). There are generics approved by FDA and\\nWHO that are bioequivalent. Legally, a drug is not a generic if it is not bioequiva-\\nlent to the original drug. FDCs also exist for AZT+3TC+nevirapine, called Duovir N\\n(Cipla) or Zidovex-LN (Ranbaxy). Patent rights for generics have often been ignored,\\nmaking these insignificant in industrial countries (see Chapter on Global Access). \\nHowever, as some patents have expired over the last years (and many will do so in\\nthe near future), even in Western countries many generics are already available for\\ndrugs such the NRTIs AZT, 3TC, AZT+3TC, the two NNRTIs efavirenz, nevirapine but\\nalso for the PI saquinavir.\\nRaltegravir 600 mg– with the sobering results of the QDMRK Study in which 800 mg\\nQD had been less effective than 400 mg BID, MSD felt into lockdown. For more than\\ntwo years, nothing happened. However, when it became apparent that raltegravir\\nwould be the only modern drug in HIV medicine that has to be given BID, the\\ncompany finally decided to develop a new formulation. The 600 mg are now inves-\\ntigated (Krishna 2013). In June 2014, the ONCEMRK was initiated. In this double-\\nblinded randomized trial, a total of 750 ART naive patients will receive raltegravir\\n1200 mg QD (two tablets) or 400 mg BID, all combined with TDF+FTC.

It is unlikely that any\\nof the following agents – except for Tenofovir-Alafenamide (TAF) – will make it to\\nthe market. Many of them have already disappeared.\\nAmdoxovir (DAPD) is a novel dioxolane guanosine NRTI that is converted in vivo\\nto the highly efficient DXG. DAPD has good efficacy against viruses resistant to\\nAZT/3TC and against hepatitis B virus (Corbett 2001). When patients showed changes\\nof the ocular lenses during early clinical trials (Thompson 2003), development was\\nhalted in 2004 and Gilead withdrew its licensing agreement with two US universi-\\nties. However, there is still hope for DAPD. Supported by RFS Pharma from Georgia\\n(US), development is ongoing. In this program, DAPD is combined with AZT to use\\nthe distinct resistance profiles of both compounds. In the first double-blind,\\n randomized study in 24 patients, the viral load declined by an impressive 1.97 logs\\nafter 10 days on 500 mg DAPD + 200 mg AZT BID. There are obviously synergistic\\neffects (Murphy 2010) that cannot be explained by interactions alone (Hurwitz 2010).\\nThe question is how to avoid the toxicity of DAPD. \\nApricitabine (ATC, AVX-754, formerly SPD-754) is a heterocyclic cytidine analog\\nthat was sold by Shire Biochem to Avexa in 2005. ATC chemically resembles 3TC\\nbut has in vitro activity against a broad spectrum of TAMs. Up to 5 nucleoside muta-\\ntions do not significantly impair its activity (Gu 2006). However, susceptibility to\\nATC is reduced when the K65R is present (Frankel 2007). A first placebo-controlled\\n6.3. ART 2017/2018: The horizon and beyond    119'),\n",

In 50 patients har-\\nboring the M184V mutation there was a reduction of 0.7-0.9 logs after three weeks\\non ATC (Cahn 2010). ATC-specific resistance mutations were not observed and could\\nnot be selected in in vitro experiments (Oliveira 2009). Cephalgia and rhinitis are\\nmost frequent, otherwise tolerability of ATC seems to be good (Gaffney 2009). What\\nabout long-term toxicity? In monkeys, there were minor skin problems, usually\\nhyperpigmentation, after 52 weeks of exposure. ATC was thus significantly less toxic\\nthan BCH-10652, which caused severe degenerative dermatopathy in all exposed\\nmonkeys (Locas 2004). 3TC and FTC significantly and competitively lower intracel-\\nlular levels of ATC. Combination with other cytidine analogs is a problem. After\\nnegotiations with large pharmaceutical companies failed in May 2010, further\\n development was discontinued and it is questionable if it will be resumed.\\nCMX 157 is also known as “HDP-Tenofovir” (HDP = hexadecyloxypropyl-ester). Like\\nTAF it is prodrug of Tenofovir and probably less nephrotoxic. In vitro CMX 157 was\\neffective against TDF-resistant mutations including K65R. A once weekly dosing\\nseems to be possibe. In 2012 the compound was purchased by MSD. \\nDioxolanthymidine (DOT) is a newer thymidine analog. Dioxolane appeared to be\\nrelatively good in preclinical trials (Chung 2005, Liang 2006). Presently, prodrugs\\nare being tested, however, clinical studies have yet to be conducted (Liang 2009).\\nEFda or 4-ethynol-2-fluor-deoxyadenosine seems to be a very effective NRTI accord-\\ning to the results of monkey testing. The SIV viral load decreased after 7 days by \\n2–3 logs (Parniak 2009, Michailidis 2014). It is also being evaluated as a potential\\nmicrobicide. There is an licensing agreement with MSD for the development of this\\nnovel drug with plans for full scale clinical development.\\nElvucitabine (ACH-126,443) is a cytidine analog developed by Achillion Pharma -\\nceuticals. It is an enantiomer of dexelvucitabine and is also effective against HBV. In\\nvitro studies show potency even in the presence of numerous resistance mutations\\n(Fabrycki 2003). It is also of interest as it seems to have an extremely long half-life\\nof up to 150 hours – this may allow once-weekly dosing (Colucci 2005). A small\\ndouble-blind study showed a reduction in viral load of between 0.7 and 0.8 logs after\\n28 days in HIV+ patients with the M184V mutation. However, this study had to be\\nprematurely terminated, as 6/56 patients developed leucopenia or rash on a dose of\\n100 mg (Dunkle 2003). It seems that mitochondrial toxicity is lower than that of\\ndexelvucitabine. On the other hand, this lower toxicity may also lower the efficiency\\nof incorporation by drug-resistant versions of HIV-1 RT (Murakami 2004). Less\\n toxicity at the expense of efficacy? In a smaller Phase II study in 77 therapy-naïve\\npatients (with efavirenz and tenofovir), elvucitabine was comparable to 3TC at 96\\nweeks (DeJesus 2010). There appear to be problems with interactions with ritonavir,\\nwhich may be due to ritonavir inhibiting an efflux gut transporter with activity\\npresent at various levels in subjects (Colucci 2009). \\nFosalvudine is an NRTI from Heidelberg Pharma, a prodrug of the fluorothymidine\\nalovudine. The active part is released only after enzymatic cleavage in the tissue. It\\nis hoped that the toxicity commonly seen with fluorothymidines can thus be\\nreduced. In a Phase II trial with 43 ART-naïve HIV+ patients, fosalvudine was well-\\ntolerated and after 2 weeks of monotherapy with 5–40 mg, viral load decreased by\\nup to 1 log (Cahn 2007). Trials with pretreated patients are being conducted in Russia\\nas well as in Argentina, although nothing is listed on clinicaltrials.gov under\\n “fosalvudine”. Animal testing on rats, however, indicate high mitochondrial toxic-\\nity (Venhoff 2009). Further development is questionable.\\n120 ART'),\n",

In Phase I/II trials (Bogner 1997, Girard 2000), fozivu-\\ndine was well-tolerated, but only moderately effective – after 4 weeks, viral load\\ndecreased by 0.7 logs at the highest doses (Girard 2000). According to the company’s\\nwebsite, they are looking for partners to be able to conduct further trials. It has been\\nsilent for a while – no one seems to be interested in a new AZT.\\nTenofovir alafenamide fumarate (“TAF”, GS-7340) is a prodrug of tenofovir (TFV)\\nthat enables higher tenofovir concentrations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.\\nTAF is converted mostly intracellularly to TFV , resulting in intracellular concentra-\\ntions of tenofovir diphosphate in PBMCs that are 5–7 fold higher and TFV plasma\\nconcentrations that are 90% lower.\\nTAF was evaluated in different doses versus tenofovir in 30 HIV+ patients. After 2 weeks\\nviral load decreased to 1.71 logs versus 0.94 logs. In more recent trials even lower doses\\nwere looked at (Ruane 2012). After 10 days of 25 mg and 40 mg, respectively, viral\\nload decreased by 1.46 and 1.73 logs. Tolerance was good. Thus, a highly promising\\ntenofovir prodrug seems to be emerging here with improved efficacy and lower sys-\\ntemic exposure (Markowitz 2014). With the success of TDF and due to the fact that its\\npatent will end by 2016, the company set up a broad development during recent years:\\nIn a Phase 2, randomized, double-blinded study the efficacy of the fixed-dose com-\\nbination elvitegravir/c plus TAF+FTC was comparable to elvitegravir/c plus TDF+FTC.\\nPatients on TAF experienced significantly smaller changes in estimated creatinine\\nclearance, renal tubular proteinuria, and bone mineral density (Sax 2014). As TAF is\\nnot a substrate for tubular transport systems, no accumulation is expected. Even in\\nthe setting of severe renal insufficiency, there is no need for dose adjustment (Bam\\n2014). In a pair of two Phase III Studies (all patients received elvitegravir/c+FTC),\\nnon-inferiority of TAF versus TDF was demonstrated in 1,733 ART naïve patients\\n(Wohl 2015). Again, patients on TAF experienced less changes in renal function and\\nin bone mineral density (Sax 2015). \\nBased on these favorable findings, Gilead has submitted the TAF coformulation\\n(“Stribild-TAF” or ”E/C/F/TAF”) for review in the U.S. and Europe. Decision is to be\\nexpected by the end of 2015. In December 2014, Gilead Sciences announced devel-\\nopment and commercialization of a fixed-dose regimen containing Janssen’s\\nrilpivirine (“Complera-TAF” or “R/F/TAF”). TAF in combination with FTC (“F/TAF”)\\nbut also stand-alone TAF (for hepatitis B) are also being developed. Furthermore,\\nstudies with TAF as a part of a PI fixed-dose combination (plus darunavir/c) are\\nongoing (Mills 2015). \\nThings will become even more complicated: as coadministration with boosted PIs\\nincreases TAF exposures by 2-fold, two different dosages are developed. The recom-\\nmended dose in R/F/TAF and in F/TAF (when coadministered with NNRTIs or INSTIs)\\nis 25 mg; if it is used as E/C/F/TAF or as F/TAF (in combination with a PI), the\\n recommended dose is 10 mg. Confusion is suspected when more complex regimens\\nor co-medication with a high potential for interactions are needed. It will be\\n challenging to avoid over-dosing, and, more importantly, under-dosing of TAF. \\nPhosphazide (Nicavir) is a nucleoside analog that was developed (and is marketed)\\nin Russia, which is very similar to AZT (Skoblov 2003). After 12 weeks of phosphazide\\nmonotherapy (400 mg), viral load in a small group of patients dropped by median\\n0.7 logs. Since phosphazide is a prodrug of AZT, it requires an additional activation\\nstep. The D67N mutation seems to reduce efficacy (Machado 1999). A small study\\nhas shown potency in combination with ddI and nevirapine (Kravtchenko 2000),\\nanother with ddI and saquinavir (Sitdykova 2003). It is still hard to see the advan-\\ntage over AZT – although better tolerability was presumed, this has not been shown.\\n6.3. ART 2017/2018: The horizon and beyond    121'),\n",

However, there were some drawbacks. In February 2013, the development of\\nLersivirine was stopped by ViiV Healthcare when it became evident that there was\\nno advantage over the available NNRTIs. More recently, the delayed onset of seizures\\nafter fosdevirine exposure and persistence after discontinuation (which was without\\nprecedent in antiretroviral drug development) led to discontinuation of another\\npromising NNRTI (Margolis 2014). \\nAIC 292 is a new NNRTI from the German company AiCuris, which gained much\\nattention at its first presentation at ICAAC in 2013 (Wildum 2013). As a diarylpyra-\\nzole-carboxamide, it differs chemically from all other NNRTIs. AIC 292 is effective\\nagainst NNRTI resistance mutations such as K103N, Y181C and G190A and even\\nagainst L100I. In Phase I the compound was well tolerated at doses up to 1400 mg\\n(n=16). There seems to be a low potential for interactions; half-life is 20 hours. A\\nPhase II study is planned (Wildum 2013). It remains to be seen, if one of the big\\npharmaceutical players in HIV medicine will be interested.\\nDoravirine (MK-1439) is a NNRTI developed by MSD. Half-life is long enough to\\nallow QD dosing. It is effective against wild type virus and against several NNRTI\\nmutations such as Y181C (Côté 2014). The resistance profile is very similar to that\\nof rilpivirine and etravirine. As all available NNRTIs is not effective against Y188L\\n(Lai 2014). Safety and PK data were evaluated in healthy volunteers (Anderson 2013).\\nIn a first study on 18 ART-naive HIV+ patients, viral load felt by 1.3–1.4 logs during\\n7 days of monotherapy (Anderson 2013). In a Phase II study, in which different\\ndosages from 25 to 200 mg doravirine were tested against efavirenz, 76% achieved\\nan undetectable viral load, compared to 64% on efavirenz. There was no clear dose-\\neffect relation (Morales-Ramirez 2014). For further development, MSD chose the \\n100 mg dosages. Several studies are ongoing.\\nRDEA806 is an NNRTI by Ardea Biosciences. The resistance barrier is very high and\\nthe potential for interactions low (Hamatake 2007). Monotherapy trials with HIV+\\npatients showed a reduction of over 1.8 logs at 7 days with excellent tolerability\\n(Moyle 2010). The data seem promising enough to start Phase IIb trials. However,\\nthe company’s website is strangely blank on the topic. \\nOut of sight, out of mind: the following NNRTIs are no longer being developed:\\n\\x81 Atevirdine – Upjohn focused their research on delavirdine (a good idea?) \\n\\x81 BIRL355BS from Boehringer Ingelheim, in 2007 due to toxicity/metabolites\\n124 ART'),\n",

On the other hand, a lot of the data below does not go\\nbeyond basic science at this stage and many of the drugs discussed may eventually\\ndisappear. \\nNew attachment inhibitors\\nAttachment of the viral glycoprotein gp120 to the CD4 receptor is the first step in\\nthe entry of HIV into the target cell. In theory, this step can be inhibited by at least\\ntwo different mechanisms, namely blocking either gp120 or CD4. Both modes of\\naction are currently under investigation. Consequently, attachment inhibitors are\\nvery heterogeneous and it is not possible to speak of a single drug class. \\nSince the beginning of the nineties, there have been a number of investigations into\\nsoluble CD4 molecules that prevent the attachment of HIV to the CD4 cell (Daar\\n1990, Schooley 1990). But, after disappointing results (probably due to the very short\\nhalf-life of soluble CD4), this approach was abandoned for a time. With the growing\\nknowledge of the mechanism of HIV entry, as well as following the success of T-20,\\nthe development of attachment inhibitors has been reinvigorated. However, most\\ndrugs are not yet very advanced, often have problematic PK data, and are therefore\\nstill in the proof-of-concept stage. There is some evidence for some polymorphisms\\nin the gp120 gene associated with in vitro resistance to attachment inhibitors\\n(Charpentier 2012).\\nFostemsavir (BMS-663068) is an attachment inhibitor from BMS. It is a prodrug of\\nTemsavir (BMS-626529), with a broad range of efficacy against several HIV isolates\\n(Nowicka-Sans 2011). It is the replacement for BMS-488043, stopped in 2004 after\\nfirst clinical data were released (Hanna 2004). As a small molecule fostemsavir binds\\nvery specifically and reversibly to HIV gp120 and thereby prevents attachment of\\nHIV to the CD4 cell. Thus, it does not bind to CD4 like ibalizumab (see below). This\\nagent drew a lot of attention at CROI in 2011 (Nettles 2011). 50 treatment-naïve\\npatients received different doses once or twice daily over 8 days. Viral load decreased\\nby 1.2 and 1.8 logs – the maximum reduction in both arms was achieved a few days\\nafter treatment had concluded. Unfortunately, no dose-related dependence was\\nobserved and inter-individual bioavailability was high. Headaches (44%) and rash\\n(16%, mostly mild) were most frequent. AI438011 is an ongoing Phase 2b,\\n randomized trial investigating different doses (600–1200 mg QD or BID) of fostem-\\nsavir versus atazanavir/r (plus TDF and raltegravir) in 251 treatment-experienced\\npatients. Through Week 48, fostemsavir showed similar efficacy to atazanavir/r. All\\nfostemsavir doses were generally well tolerated with no dose response safety signals\\nreported, thus supporting the continued development of  fostemsavir (Lalezari 2014,\\nThompson 2015).\\nResistance occurs quickly as the binding site of gp120 is one of the most variable\\ngene regions of all (Madani 2010). Fortunately, no resistance to temsavir was selected\\non monotherapy with fostemsavir (Ray 2013). However, another study showed that\\nsome patients without previous treatment with attachment inhibitors developed\\nresistance to temsavir due to subtype-related polymorphisms in the gp120 region\\n(Charpentier 2012). Recently, the genotypic correlates of susceptibility to temsavir\\nhave been characterized (Zhou 2014). \\nIbalizumab (formerly TNX-355 or HU5A8) is a monoclonal antibody that binds to\\nthe CD4 receptor preventing entry of HIV. The mechanism of action has not been\\nclearly described. In contrast to other attachment inhibitors, ibalizumab does not\\nseem to prevent binding of gp120 to CD4, but rather through conformational\\nchanges and thereby the binding of gp120 to CXCR4. Some experts describe it as a\\nco-receptor antagonist. It is administered intravenously. Following the initial early\\n128 ART'),\n",

There seems to be an inverse correlation between the sensitivity for\\n ibalizumab and soluble CD4, which does not work on its own, as shown above\\n(Duensing 2006). Resistance causes a higher sensitivity towards soluble CD4 and the\\ngp120 antibody VC01, which is why attempts were made to administer ibalizumab\\nin a cocktail of CD4 and VC01 (Pace 2011). First data on resistance have been pub-\\nlished (Toma 2011). However, one issue will be whether binding to CD4 will affect\\nthe functionality of the CD4 T cells. There have been no negative effects reported\\nso far and it seems that the binding site for ibalizumab to CD4 receptors is localized\\ndifferently from the molecules. The CD4 T cells may be able to function normally,\\neven if ibalizumab occupies the HIV binding site. \\nOriginally ibalizumab was being developed by Tanox Biosystems (Houston, USA) and\\nlater taken over by the biotechnology company Genentech in 2007. ACTG passed\\non sponsoring the Phase III trials. In mid-2007 Genentech sold the license for\\n ibalizumab to TaiMed Biologics, a Taiwanese biotech company – they are presently\\nplanning Phase IIb trials in Europe and the USA. According to www.clinicaltrials.gov,\\nhowever, the only study currently running is a trial on subcutaneous injections in\\nthe setting of pre-exposure prophylaxis. \\nReferences \\nCharpentier C, Larrouy L, Visseaux B, et al.

The two most important ones, CXCR4 and CCR5, were discovered in the\\nmid-90s (see Chapter 2). Both receptors can be blocked. In 2007, maraviroc was\\nlicensed as the first CCR5 antagonist. These small molecules are given orally and\\nbind allosterically to the receptor. Besides these allosteric inhibitors there are mon-\\noclonal antibodies binding directly to the receptor. Below we will discuss those agents\\nwith published data.\\nCCR5 antagonists (small molecules)\\nCenicrivoc (TBR-652 or formerly TAK-652) is an orally-available CCR5 antagonist\\nby the Japanese company Takeda that has now been bought by Tobira. Laboratory\\ndata demonstrated that several mutations in the V3 region (and in the env gene)\\nmust exist for complete resistance towards TAK-652. Tropism does not seem to change\\nwhen resistance occurs (Baba 2007). Oral bioavailability is good and with a half-life\\nof 35–40 hours a once-daily dosage is possible (Martin 2012). The oral availability is\\nimproved with food intake. TBR-652 also seems to be effective against CCR2, a recep-\\ntor on monocytes, dendritic and memory T cells that may have anti-inflammatory\\nproperties as well. There are no concerns regarding its safety and the substance has\\nshown good tolerability in healthy volunteers (Palleja 2009). In a first double-blind\\ndose-ranging study of 10 days monotherapy in 54 patients, the viral load decreased\\nby a maximum of 1.5–1.8 logs (Lalezari 2011, Marier 2011). Another Phase II study\\non 150 patients, in which different doses of cenicriviroc are compared with efavirenz\\n(all patients received TDF+FTC), 73–76% and 71% of the patients achieved a viral\\nload of less than 50 copies/ml, respectively. However, virological failure was more\\nfrequent with cenicriviroc (12–14% versus 4%). Tolerability was good (Gathe 2013). \\nPF-232798 is an orally available CCR5 antagonist by ViiV Healthcare. It has a long\\nhalf-life and can probably be administered once daily. In vitro it reacts well to\\n maraviroc resistance (Stupple 2011). In healthy volunteers, it was well tolerated (Dorr\\n2008).\\nSCH-532706 is a new CCR5 antagonist from Schering (now Merck). At first, there\\nseems to be no advantage of this agent over vicriviroc. A total of 12 patients receiv-\\ning 60 mg of SCH-532706 (with 100 mg ritonavir) showed a reduction of viral load\\nof up to 1.6 logs at 15 days (Pett 2009). A once-daily administration seems possible.\\nThere may be a positive effect on immune activation (Pett 2010) – however, facing\\nthe experiences with vicriviroc, it seems unlikely that this agent will be further\\n developed.\\n130 ART'),\n",

Clinical devel-\\nopment of this promising substance was halted in July 2010 after a pooled analysis\\nof two Phase III trials, VICTOR E3 and E4 (Gathe 2010). A total of 721 pretreated\\npatients received 30 mg vicriviroc or placebo in an optimized therapy containing\\nmainly darunavir/r and/or raltegravir. No difference was observed after 48 weeks\\n(64% versus 62% below 50 copies/ml). Despite obvious differences in patients who\\nonly had two active drugs (70% versus 55%), Merck decided to stop development of\\nvicriviroc. We mention this because it clearly shows the problems new agents will\\nface in the future. With the improvement of therapies over time, it is becoming more\\nand more difficult to show positive effects – background therapies have become “too”\\ngood. \\nOther innovative CCR5 blockers\\nHGS004 (CCR5mAb004) developed by Human Genome Sciences is a monoclonal\\nantibody showing a high resistance barrier in vitro (Giguel 2006). The half-life is\\napproximately 5–8 days, and 80% of the receptors are occupied over a period of up\\nto 4 weeks after a single dose. In an initial trial, 54 ART-naïve patients received a\\nsingle infusion between 0.4 and 40 mg/kg HGS004 or placebo (Lalezari 2008). More\\nthan half the patients in the higher dose arms showed a reduction of at least one\\nlog at 14 days. There are reports of synergistic effects with maraviroc (Latinovic\\n2011a). Possibly, the company has now turned their attention to HGS101, which is\\neven more effective in vitro and in addition effective against maraviroc-resistant virus\\n(Latinovic 2011b).\\nPRO 140 is a monoclonal antibody by the company Progenics, directed against\\nhuman CCR5 receptors (Trkola 2001). It is not a chemokine derivative like  maraviroc\\nor vicriviroc and even seems to have a synergistic effect (Murga 2006). The resist-\\nance barrier is probably high (Jacobsen 2010). PRO 140 is administered intravenously.\\nThe normal function of CCR5 receptors should not be interfered with, at least not\\nin the required dosages for inhibition of HIV replication (Gardner 2003). Healthy\\npatients showed excellent tolerability to intravenous single administration of the\\ndrug and dose-dependent concentrations were measured (Olson 2005). Of note,\\nCCR5 receptors were occupied for up to 60 days and more (Olson 2006). In a trial\\nwith 39 HIV+ patients treated with intravenous single doses of between 0.5 and \\n5.0 mg/kg, viral load decreased with the highest doses by 1.83 logs with a nadir at\\nday 10 (Jacobson 2008). A higher dosage does not seem to achieve more (Jacobsen\\n2010). Comparable effects are reached with weekly subcutaneous administration\\n(Jacobson 2010). PRO 140‘s tolerability seems excellent, and it has the possibility of\\nbeing a weekly therapy (Tenorio 2011). \\nESN-196 is a pilot agent developed by Euroscreen, which does not block the co-\\nreceptor, but is agonistic, like the chemokine RANTES, causing internalization of the\\nreceptor (Ferain 2011). This CCR5 agonist reduces the receptor density on the cell\\nsurface. Therefore, it is as effective as maravirocin vitro. As an agent with an extended\\neffect, it could become an alternative, if proven safe in clinical trials.\\nAprepitant (Emend\\n®) is approved as an antiemetic in patients receiving highly\\n emetogenous chemotherapy. It apparently has an effect on R5-tropic viruses caused\\nby a down-regulation of the CCR5 receptors. Lab data showed dose-dependent effects\\non HIV replication (Wang 2007, Manak 2010). In a first clinical trial in HIV+ patients,\\nhowever, no effects on plasma viremia were found (Tebas 2011). \\n6.3. ART 2017/2018: The horizon and beyond    131'),\n",

X4 viruses are found in approximately 50% of cases in intensely\\npre-treated patients (Hoffmann 2007). This is why theoretically the blocking of\\nCXCR4 receptors seems so attractive – those patients with limited options would\\nbenefit most. The combination with CCR5 antagonists seems to be an interesting\\noption. However, the development of CXCR4 antagonists is less advanced than that\\nof the CCR5 antagonists (Peled 2011). This is mainly because theoretically, less clin-\\nical consequences are feared with the CCR5 blockade – individuals with a CCR5\\ngenetic defect are healthy; although, an inherent and mostly harmless defect with\\nCXCR4 in humans, has not been seen. CXCR4 blockade had severe consequences\\nin animal testing, for example in angiogenetic hematopoiesis or brain development\\n(Tachibana 1998, Nagasawa 1998, Zou 1998).\\nYears of basic research will be necessary until large clinical studies can be attempted.\\nNevertheless, several chemically different substances are in preclinical testing\\n(Jenkinson 2010, Miller 2010, Skerl 2010, Steen 2010, Thakkar 2010, auerbach 2012,\\nVinader 2013). Despite the hurdles, CXCR4 antagonists seem to be a promising class.\\nResearch has shown an interesting side effect: some agents are able to mobilize stem\\ncells. This is why one of the pilot drugs, AMD 3100, presently under the name plex-\\nifor, is being further developed as a growth factor for leukocytes as well as a G-CSF\\nalternative (Kean 2011, Ratajczak 2011). Such an effect, however, is obviously not\\ndesired in permanent HIV therapy. CXCR4 antagonists are also being discussed in\\nlupus erythematodes therapy (Chong 2009).\\nAMD 11070 is a CXCR4 antagonist developed by AnorMED. Healthy volunteers\\nshowed good tolerability with AMD 070, but often developed leukocytosis (Stone\\n2004). The efficacy in HIV+ patients with dual-tropic viruses was validated in two\\npilot studies (Moyle 2007, Saag 2007). Viral load was lowered by at least one log in\\n7/15 patients on 10 days of monotherapy. However, in 2007, development was\\nstopped because of liver toxicity. Binding to the X4 receptor is localized differently\\nthan the precursor agent AMD 3100, so there may be some scope for development\\nof new, more potent and less toxic CXCR4 antagonists (Wong 2007) – at least a start\\nwas made with AMD 11070 and evidence of efficacy was found. Presently AMD 3465\\nseems to be another possibility (Bodart 2009).\\nKRH-3955 and KRH-3140 are two CXCR4 antagonists that have proven effective in\\nmouse models (Tanaka 2006). According to preclinical data, KRH-3955 seems espe-\\ncially promising (Murakami 2009) and bioavailability is good in dogs and monkeys\\n(Nakasone 2013). Likewise, POL3026 is still preclinical and may help inhibit selected\\nX4 shifts while on CCR5 antagonists (Moncunill 2008).\\nReferences \\nAuerbach DJ, Lin Y, Miao H, et al.

Subcutaneous injection required for many FIs is unap-\\npealing for patients and clinicians. It still needs to be demonstrated, whether small\\nmolecule FIs, i.e., that are orally bioavailable, are effective (Jiang 2004). Addition of\\na cholesterol group to an HIV-1 peptide fusion inhibitor may dramatically increase\\nits antiviral potency (Ingallinella 2009). \\nSifuvirtide is an FI developed in China. In animal testing with monkeys a longer\\nhalf-life (39 hours) and a higher affinity towards gp41 rather than towards T-20 was\\nobserved (Dai 2005). Sifuvirtide was well-tolerated in healthy patients (He 2008) and\\ninteresting synergetic effects were reported with T-20 (Pan 2009). However, there\\nseem to be some cross-resistances (Liu 2010, Yao 2012). This may not be the case for\\nthe newer FI albuvirtide, from China as well (Chong 2012).\\n134 ART'),\n",

The efficacy of this agent, which has been repeatedly tested in HIV+ patients\\nfor years, was shown in three Phase II trials.

As is the case for integrase inhibitors, 2005 can be called the intro-\\nductory year: this was the first time an agent was shown to have an antiviral effect\\non HIV+ patients. Maturation inhibitors are, without a doubt, an interesting class of\\nnew drugs. Whether any of the agents will make it out of the clinic remains uncer-\\ntain, as several problems have surfaced during the development of the prototype,\\nbevirimat. However, these problems can be overcome with new agents (Urano 2014). \\nBevirimat (MPC-4326, formerly PA-457) is a derivative of betulinic acid, which is\\nisolated as triterpene carbonic acid from birch bark. It was produced by Panacos,\\nwhich was sold to Myriad Pharmaceuticals. Bevirimat inhibits budding or matura-\\ntion of new virions (Li 2003) by inhibiting the transition of the capsid precursor\\n(p25) into the mature capsid protein (p24). This prevents the production of infec-\\ntious viruses. Its long half-life allows once daily dosing (Martin 2007, Smith 2007).\\nTolerability of bevirimat in more than 650 patients has been good, including in the\\npresence of atazanavir (Martin 2008). \\nData from a placebo-controlled Phase IIa trial was published in autumn 2005, in\\nwhich patients received an oral once-daily monotherapy of bevirimat for 10 days\\n(Beatty 2005). In the highest dose group (200 mg) viral load decreased by 1.03 logs\\n(median); in the 100 mg group it was just 0.48 logs. However, some patients showed\\nno effect on the viral load, which can be ascribed to “natural” polymorphisms in\\nthe gag gene (van Baelen 2009, Lu 2011). Patients harbouring viruses with no gag\\npolymorphisms (mutations) on the positions Q369, V370 or T371 before therapy\\nresponded better to bevirimat. In a more recent monotherapy study with 32 patients\\nreceiving higher dosing, a reduction of viral load of 0.54 and 0.7 logs respectively,\\nwas observed with 200 or 300 mg after 14 days. Without the polymorphisms, effects\\nwere greater than the one log level, those with the polymorphisms had a drop of\\nonly 0.2 logs (Bloch 2009). Only about 50-70% of all individuals tested, seemed not\\nto have these gag polymorphisms. There appears to be no difference between treat-\\nment-naïve and pre-treated patients, nor is there any influence due to the degree of\\nthe underlying immunodeficiency (Margot 2009, Knapp 2009, Seclén 2010). However,\\nthere seems to be a strong correlation with PI resistance (Verheyen 2010, Fun 2011). \\n136 ART'),\n",

However, newer in vitro data on maturation\\ninhibitor show that this potential drug class remains a focus for ongoing research.\\nSecond-generation maturation inhibitors may overcome the problem of the gag poly-\\nmorphisms (Urano 2014). \\nBMS-955176 looks much more promising than bevirimat, with retained activity even\\nagainst viruses with baseline gag polymorphisms. In a Phase IIa, randomized, trial,\\nactivity and safety of 10 days of monotherapy with BMS-955176 (dosages 5-120 mg\\nOD) was evaluated in 40 HIV+ patients.

Although repeatedly discussed as an alternative or supplement,\\nthese therapies lack proof of clinical benefit. An important example is the failure of\\nthe two large IL-2 studies (see below). Some approaches are nevertheless addressed\\nhere briefly (in alphabetic order).\\nCorticosteroids do not stand the test of controlled studies. In a placebo-controlled\\nstudy with 0.5 mg prednisone/kg over 8 weeks, there were no effects on CD4 T cells\\nor viral load (McComsey 2001). In ACTG 349, 24 patients were treated with 40 mg\\nprednisone daily or not in a double-blind randomized design (Wallis 2003). After\\n8 weeks, there was a trend towards higher levels of CD4 T cells in the prednisone\\narm, but there were no effects on activation markers or apoptosis. Two patients on\\nprednisone developed necrosis of the femoral head. This study should caution\\nanyone before considering steroids for immunological reasons.\\nCyclosporin A (Sandimmune\\n®) – Immune activation may lead to increased HIV\\nreplication, and a treatment hypothesis has been to suppress the immune system in\\nan attempt to slow down viral replication. This is the rationale behind studies inves-\\ntigating the use of cyclosporin A, a drug normally used for prophylaxis of transplant\\nrejection after allogenic organ transplantation. However, results of clinical trials have\\nbeen disappointing. Cyclosporin A had no effect on CD4 or CD8 T cell count, nor\\non expression of activation markers (Calabrese 2002, Lederman 2006). This was not\\nonly the case in chronically but also in acutely infected patients (Miro 2009,\\nMarkowitz 2010). Cyclosporin A therefore probably has a limited future in HIV therapy.\\nG-CSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) is available as filgastrim (Neupogen\\n®),\\nlenogastrim (Granocyte®) and most recently as less expensive biosimilars (in Europe).\\nIt is also licensed for permanent neutropenia in advanced HIV infection to avoid\\nbacterial infection. In a randomized study with 258 HIV-infected patients with CD4\\nT cells under 200/µl, the rate of severe neutropenia was 2% versus 22% in the control\\ngroup after 24 weeks (Kuritzkes 1998). Incidence of bacterial infection was reduced\\nby 31% and the number of inpatient days dropped by 45%. No effects on viral load\\n138 ART'),\n",

Patients with CMV retinitis showed a large survival benefit on G-CSF\\n(Davidson 2002). Although severe neutropenia has become rare on ART, G-CSF can\\nbe useful, especially in chemotherapy, with interferon or other myelo-suppressive\\ndrugs such as valgancyclovir.  \\nGM-CSF (granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor) is available as\\n molgramostim (Leucomax\\n®) or sargramostim (Prokine ®). Three double-blind,\\n randomized studies showed a slight effect on viral load (Angel 2000, Skowron 1999,\\nBrites 2000). However, in one study in patients with uncontrolled infection, there\\nwas a slight increase of viremia (Jacobsen 2003). GM-CSF seems to prevent signifi-\\ncant loss of CD4 T cells during treatment interruptions (Fagard 2003). Given the side\\neffects and significant cost of GM-CSF, it cannot be recommended outside clinical\\nstudies. GM-CSF is not licensed in Europe.\\nHydroxyurea (HU, Litalir\\n®) is an old chemotherapeutic agent with relatively low\\ntoxicity still being used today in hematology (mostly in chronic myelogenous\\nleukemia). It inhibits DNA synthesis via the ribonucleotide reductase, and leads to\\nan intracellular shortage of deoxynucleotide triphosphates. A synergistic effect on\\nHIV replication in combination with ddI was demonstrated in 1994 (Lori 1994). A\\nSwiss study, in which 144 patients were treated with hydroxyurea (HU) or placebo\\nplus d4T+ddI, attracted attention in 1998 (Rutschmann 1998). After 12 weeks,\\n54% (versus 28% in the placebo group) demonstrated a viral load below\\n200 copies/ml. Was this the discovery of a new cheaper option for HIV treatment?\\nHydroxyurea became even more fashionable after publication of the first “Berlin\\nPatient”, a patient who had been treated with hydroxyurea in addition to indinavir\\nand ddI during acute infection, had stopped all therapy after a few months and\\n subsequently showed no detectable plasma viremia (Lisziewicz 1999). Was this\\n unexpected outcome due to hydroxyurea? Several small studies from the US and\\nArgentina seemed to confirm these positive results. Many treating physicians added\\nthe drug to ART and many started to dream of a cheap combination of ddI+HU for\\nAfrica. These initial hopes subsided rapidly. In particular, the combination of HU\\nwith ddI and d4T turned out to be particularly toxic: severe polyneuropathy (Moore\\n2000) and fatal pancreatitis were reported (Havlir 2001). Three randomized studies\\nfailed to show any effect, except for high rates of toxicity (Blanckenberg 2004,\\nStebbing 2004, Swindels 2005). Even in patients with acute HIV infection there was\\nno effect. Thus, more Berlin patients could not be “reproduced” (Zala 2002).\\nHydroxyurea should not be used in antiretroviral therapy.\\nInterferons have an antiretroviral effect that has been known for years (Mildvan\\n1996). The antiviral effect of 3 million IU daily or with pegylated interferon weekly\\nis about 0.5-1 log (Haas 2000, Hatzakis 2001, Asmuth 2010). Higher dosing may\\nincrease this effect (Hatzakis 2001). We have seen patients coinfected with HIV/HCV ,\\nwho achieved an undetectable HIV RNA during hepatitis C therapy with interferon\\nand ribavirin only. However, an in-depth investigation of the antiviral activity of\\ninterferon was not conducted, because of the subcutaneous delivery route and its\\nnot insignificant side effects. Recently, interferons seem to be experiencing a come-\\nback, as they may acheive importance as an immune modulator and play a role in\\neradication (Papasavvas 2012, Mexas 2012). In one trial, 9 out of 20 patients who\\nreceived pegylated interferon and interrupted ART, showed viral load below \\n400 copies/ml after 12 weeks of IFN monotherapy (Azzoni 2013). \\nInterleukin-2 (IL-2, aldesleukin, Proleukin\\n®) is a cytokine produced by activated\\nT cells that induces proliferation and cytokine production in T cells, B cells and NK\\ncells.

The most important effect of IL-2 in HIV medicine is the increase\\nin CD4 and CD8 T cells, which may be quite impressive in individual cases. CD45RO\\nmemory cells initially increase, followed by naïve CD45RA T cells (Chun 1999,\\nCarcelain 2003). This effect is mainly due to a reduced T cell turnover (Kovacz 2005,\\nSereti 2005, Vento 2006). \\nThe question of whether the CD4 T cells generated by IL-2 would lead to clinical\\nbenefit, was answered by two large randomized studies, ESPRIT and SILCAAT, in 2009\\n(Abrams 2009). In the ESPRIT study, 4,131 patients with at least 300 CD4 T cells/µl\\nwere treated with and without IL-2 in addition to ART. SILCAAT had a similar concept,\\nbut enrolled 1695 patients with 50-299 CD4 T cells/µl. The results were very\\n disappointing. Although supplementation of ART with IL-2 resulted in a statistically\\nsignificant increase in CD4 T cell count (ESPRIT: +160, SILCAAT: +59 CD4 T cells/µl),\\nit did not lead to a clinical benefit. Despite improved CD4 T cells with IL-2, patients\\ndid not develop less opportunistic infections and mortality was not reduced.\\nMoreover, serious adverse events (including fever, malaise, injection site reactions\\nand deep-vein thrombosis) were more likely to occur among patients receiving IL-2\\nin the ESPRIT study. Another randomized study (STALWART) provided similar results\\n(Tavel 2011). Conclusion: IL-2 as a supplementary therapy in HIV+ patients is no\\nlonger viable.\\nInterleukin-7 may be more promising. This cytokine plays a fundamental role in \\nT cell homeostasis and is implicated in thymopoiesis and in peripheral expansion\\nand survival of T lymphocytes (Review: Chahroudi 2010). Two small randomized\\nplacebo-controlled pilot trials with 6 and 16 HIV+ patients, respectively, demon-\\nstrated a good increase of CD4 T cells with different subcutaneous doses. The toler-\\nability was good and side effects typical for interleukin-2 were not observed (Levy\\n2009, Sereti 2009). Another small studies showed promising results (Lévy 2013). If\\nthese results are confirmed, interleukin-7 may become an option for patients whose\\nimmune constitution remains poor despite good viral load suppression on ART. \\nInterleukin-12 stimulates T lymphocytes and NK cells to generate a Th1-type\\nimmune response. In a randomized Phase I study with rhIL-12 100 ng/kg 2 x week,\\nthe drug was well tolerated but had no effect on lymphocyte subpopulations, antigen-\\nspecific immune response or viral load (Jacobson 2002). Further development has\\nnot happened. The same would appear to be true for interleukin-10 (Angel 2000)\\nor interleukin-15 (Ahmad 2005). In the age of highly effective antiretroviral thera-\\npies, such experimental therapies have to meet ever-increasing standards. \\nMurabutide is a synthetic muramyldipeptide with a variety of effects on the immune\\nsystem. It can raise unspecific resistance to infection, induce anti-inflammatory\\ncytokines and growth factors, and strengthen the antiviral effects of cytokines such\\nas IL-2 or interferon. In HIV+ patients, a team in France has used it mainly as an\\nimmune modulator, although only in small studies, and at best, with moderate results\\n(Bahr 2003).\\nMycophenol (Cellcept\\n®) has a theoretical concept similar to that of hydroxyurea\\nand cyclosporin A. Mycophenol inhibits inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydroge-\\nnase and is normally used for prophylaxis of acute transplant rejection in patients\\nwith allogenic kidney, heart or liver transplants, as well as for some autoimmune\\ndiseases. Inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation and the subsequent reduction of\\ntarget cells should theoretically inhibit replication of HIV. Initial reports seem to\\ndemonstrate an effect on viral load, at least in some patients (Margolis 2002, Press\\n2002). Whether this will be confirmed by randomized trials seems uncertain. More\\ncurrent data suggest that this is unlikely (Sankatsing 2004, Margolis 2006). \\n140 ART'),\n",

However, single-cell-based antibody cloning methods have recently\\nuncovered a new generation of far more potent broadly neutralizing antibodies\\n(BNAbs) to HIV that have shown prophylactic and therapeutic activities in animal\\nmodels. In a first-in-man dose escalation Phase I trial, 3BNC117, a potent human\\nCD4 binding site antibody, was well tolerated. A single 30 mg/kg infusion reduced\\nthe viral load by 0.8-2.5 logs and viraemia remained significantly reduced for 28\\ndays. Emergence of resistant viral strains was variable, with some individuals remain-\\ning sensitive to 3BNC117 for a period of 28 days. It is clear that with these results,\\nimmunotherapy will be explored as a new modality for HIV-1 prevention and therapy\\n(Caskey 2015). \\nRemune\\n®, the prototype of therapeutic vaccination, has gone from disaster to\\n disaster. Developed by a team headed by the since-deceased Jonas Salk, Remune® was\\na therapeutic vaccine comprised of an envelope-depleted (gp120) virus which,\\nalthough indeed immunogenic, does not seem to provide any clinical benefit (i.e.,\\nprolongation of life or delay of disease progression). A large trial was interrupted pre-\\nmaturely in May 1999. More than 2500 patients had taken part for a mean of 89 weeks\\nin this study, which was designed to evaluate the addition of Remune\\n® to ART. As\\nwell as the lack of clinical benefit, advantages with respect to CD4 T cell counts or\\nviral loads could not be shown (Kahn 2000). \\nTHC, cannabinoids have no anti-HIV effect. A controlled, randomized study, in\\nwhich patients could either smoke marijuana or receive THC (dronabinol, Marinol\\n®)\\nor placebo in addition to ART, showed no effects on lymphocyte subpopulations,\\nlymphocyte function or viral load after three weeks (Bredt 2002). THC, which is\\nmetabolized via the cytochrome P450 system, had no detrimental effects on PI plasma\\nlevels (Abrams 2003). One randomized study showed that smoking cannabis was\\nwell-tolerated and effectively relieved chronic neuropathic pain from HIV-associated\\nsensory neuropathy. The findings were comparable to oral drugs used for chronic\\nneuropathic pain (Abrams 2007). \\nVitamins: It remains a matter of debate whether the addition of micronutrient sup-\\nplements to ART may provide clinical benefits. Vitamins may even be harmful. In a\\nlarge, double blinded, randomized study in Africa, 3.418 HIV+ patients received high-\\ndose vs standard-dose multivitamin supplementation (vitamin B complex, vitamin\\nC, and vitamin E) for 24 months (Isanaka 2012). High-dose multivitamin supple-\\nments did not result in a decrease in HIV disease progression or death. The study\\nwas stopped early in March 2009 because of increased ALT levels in patients receiv-\\ning the high-dose multivitamin supplement. However, in another randomized study\\nin Botswana on 878 patients, 24 months with a single supplement containing\\n multivitamins and selenium was safe and significantly reduced the risk of immune\\ndecline and morbidity (Baum 2013). \\nReferences\\nAbrams D, Lévy Y, Losso MH, et al.

The ulti-\\nmate goal in HIV medicine – a cure – is not a realistic scenario in the immediate\\nfuture, although more and more effort and time is being spent in the cure arena.\\nThus, the current (and realistic) goal of ART in 2015/16 is to prolong the patient’s\\nlife and maintain the best possible quality of health and life. Patients and physicians\\nmost likely have to deal with lifelong treatment. Lifelong, meaning decades, as many\\nepidemiological studies suggest a normal life expectancy for HIV+ patients (Obel\\n2011, Nakagawa 2012). The goals and principles of lifelong treatment will be\\n discussed in the first part of this. The treatment goal “HIV cure” will be discussed\\nseparately in the second part.\\n6.4.1. Success and failure of lifelong treatment\\nBoth success and failure of treatment can be evaluated using the same criteria – viro-\\nlogic, immunologic or clinical. The first indicator, virologic, is the change in viral\\nload. This is followed, often a little later, by immunologic markers (rise or fall in CD4\\nT cell count). Clinical outcome usually only becomes apparent much later – first the\\nlab values deteriorate, then the patient; or vice-versa, as lab values get better, the\\npatient generally follows. The clinical success of ART for asymptomatic patients is\\noften not perceived, although the risk of opportunistic infections is reduced to half\\nafter only three months on ART (Ledergerber 1999) – the individual may not realize\\nwhat was avoided by starting therapy. \\nVirological treatment success and failure\\nOn ART, viral load declines in at least two phases (see Monitoring). An initial, very\\nrapid decrease in the first few weeks is followed by a longer phase, in which plasma\\nviremia declines slowly. Virological treatment success is usually understood as being\\nthe reduction of viral load to below the level of detection (usually 50 copies/ml).\\nThis should be reached after 3–4 months; in cases of very high baseline viral load it\\nmay take longer. However, a viral load above the level of detection after six months\\nof treatment almost always needs to be evaluated. The same is true if a rebound in\\nviral load is confirmed. \\nThe more rapid and greater the decrease in viral load, the longer the therapeutic\\neffect (Kempf 1998, Powderly 1999). In the early INCAS Trial, the relative risk of\\ntreatment failure in patients who had reached a viral load below 20 copies/ml was\\n20 times lower than in those who never reached 400 copies/ml (Raboud 1998).\\nVirologic treatment failure can be recognized quite early. In practice, viral load should\\nbe monitored after four weeks on ART. This is useful not only to the patient for\\nreasons of well-being (“less virus, more CD4 cells”). But it is also an important indi-\\ncation for the continued success of treatment. If the viral load is not below 5,000\\ncopies after four weeks of ART, later treatment failure is likely (Maggiolo 2000). If\\nthe viral load is not below 500 copies/ml or at least one log below baseline, the like-\\nlihood of having a viral load of 500 copies/ml at week 24 is only 9% (Demeter 2001).\\nIn ACTG 5202, a less robust week 4 virologic response was associated with higher\\nrisk for subsequent virologic failure (Gant 2013). According to another prospective\\nstudy, virological response can be predicted even after 7 days (Haubrich 2011).\\nHowever, viral load testing after such short periods of ART in previously untreated\\npatients is not clinical routine.\\n144 ART'),\n",

It is based on the\\n currently available viral load assays. Whether 60 copies/ml are indeed worse than\\n30 copies/ml and indicate a lower success of treatment has yet to be proven. In the\\ncase of a persistent low level viremia (LLV) between 20 and 50 copies/ml, the risk of\\nvirological failure seems not to be increased (Charpentier 2012). There are, however,\\nother studies suggesting an association between the level of viremia and virological\\nfailure, even at very low levels (Maggiolo 2012, Pugliuese 2013). Thus, the signifi-\\ncance of LLV is still a matter of a debate. At such low levels, methodological inac-\\ncuracies must also be taken into account. A single detectable viral load “blip” to low\\nlevels (~1000 copies/ml) is often irrelevant (see below). Blips need to be distinguished\\nfrom low, repetitive, measurable plasma viremia (50–400 copies/ml), in which the\\nrisk of resistance has been shown to be higher (Gunthard 1998, Nettles 2004, Taiwo\\n2012). If immune activation and inflammatory parameters are increased in these\\npatients is still controversially discussed (Eastburn 2011, Taiwo 2012, Reus 2013).\\nA viral load “below the level of detection” of 50 copies/ml means just that – no more,\\nno less. A total of 50 copies/ml indicate that 5 liters of blood contain 250,000 virions;\\nin addition, even more actively replicating viruses are present in the lymphatic\\norgans. Thus, theoretically, a measurable viremia, even at very low levels, may\\n possibly translate to a higher risk of resistance in the long-term. Perhaps there is\\nindeed a relevant difference between 50 and 10 copies/ml with regard to the risk of\\ndeveloping resistance. We just do not know yet.\\nRisk factors for virological failure are pre-treatment with antiretroviral agents (exist-\\ning resistance mutations) and low adherence. Whether the baseline CD4 T cell counts\\nor the baseline plasma viremia play a role in treatment-naïve patients has not been\\nconclusively proven (see chapter on When to Start ART). It seems that many other\\nrisk factors associated with virological failure or response are not known. A new area\\nin this setting is pharmacogenetic research focusing on how genes influence an indi-\\nvidual response to drugs. Investigators have begun to identify associations among\\nhuman genetic variants, predisposition to HIV drug toxicities, and likelihood of viro-\\nlogic response. These include HLA typing and enzyme polymorphisms (Haas 2006).\\nPharmacogenomic testing will ultimately benefit persons living with HIV through\\nbetter individualized treatment.\\nMore good news for today is that morbidity and mortality may be lowered signifi-\\ncantly even if the viral load is not decreased to below the level of detection (Grabar\\n2000, Deeks 2002). Patients often remain immunologically stable for a long time,\\neven with insufficient viral suppression. A large cohort study has shown that CD4\\nT cells do not drop as long as the viral load remains below 10,000 copies/ml or at\\nleast 1.5 logs below the individual set point (Lederberger 2004). However, with the\\nnew drug classes much more is possible now than in the 90s. Thus, plasma viremia\\nshould be reduced to below the detection limit in all patients.\\nHow long does virological treatment success last?\\nLittle is known about how long treatments remain effective. The belief that treat-\\nment success is limited to only a few years is widespread. It originated during the\\nearly years of ART. Many patients at the time were inadequately pretreated with\\nmono- or dual-therapy, and had thus developed extensive resistance. In such patients,\\nthe effect of treatment was often limited, as even a single point mutation was often\\nenough to topple a whole regimen. Today, especially in therapy-naïve patients\\nwithout pre-existing mutations, the risk of treatment failure is much less.\\nAfter almost 20 years of using combination ART, a very high number of patients still\\nhave viral loads below the level of detection. This is particularly true for patients\\nwho were adequately treated from the start (starting with triple therapy and/or rapid\\n6.4. Goals and principles of therapy    145'),\n",

One of the few trials with a longer follow-\\nup period studied 336 antiretroviral-naïve patients who had reached a viral load\\nbelow 50 copies/ml within 24 weeks (Phillips 2001). After 3.3 years, the risk of viral\\nrebound seemed at first glance to be relatively high at 25.3%. More detailed analy-\\nsis showed that a large proportion of the patients experiencing viral rebound had\\nactually interrupted ART. True virological failure was only seen in 14 patients, which\\ncorresponds to a risk of 5.2% after 3.3 years. Most importantly, the risk of virologi-\\ncal failure decreased significantly with time.\\nThis is supported by cohort studies showing that the rates of virological failure due\\nto resistance have markedly declined in recent years (Lohse 2005, Lampe 2006).\\nAntiretroviral therapies and treating physicians are getting better and better. As\\ndemonstrated by a large cohort study in Europe in 1995–96, 58% achieved HIV-1\\nRNA of 500 copies/ml or less by 6 months, compared with 83% in 2002–03 (May\\n2006). Nowadays, most patients have a constant viral load below 50 copies/ml. In\\nmany centers today, at least 90% of patients on ART have an undetectable plasma\\nviremia. The cohort in Bonn is a good example. In 2007, only 57 out of 560 (10%)\\npatients on ART showed detectable viremia. In 32 of these patients, adherence\\n problems were a major cause and only 9% had a multiresistant virus (Klein 2009).\\nThese studies clearly show that, providing treatment is not interrupted, viral load\\ncan remain below the level of detection for many years, probably decades. \\nBlips – do they mean virological failure?\\nBlips are understood to be transient and relatively small increases in viral load, where\\nthe viral load before and after the blip was below 50 copies/ml. At least three meas-\\nurements of viral load are therefore required to be able to identify a blip. Blips are a\\nfrequent phenomenon of patients on ART and are observed in 20–40%\\n(Sungkanuparph 2005). Blips often worry both patients and clinicians: Is this the\\nbeginning of treatment failure? Although a few studies indicate that this is not the\\ncase in the medium-term (Havlir 2001, Mira 2002, Sungkanuparph 2005), little is\\nknown about the causes of blips. For example, there has been no consistent data\\nabout association between compliance and blip frequency. While some studies did\\nnot find any association (Di Mascio 2003, Miller 2004), others did (Podsadecki 2007).\\nIt is also possible that blips are the result of immunological mechanisms. The earlier\\npatients are treated in the course of infection, i.e., the higher the CD4 T cell count\\nat therapy initiation, the more seldom blips seem to occur (Di Mascio 2003+2004,\\nSungkanuparph 2005). There does not appear to be any association with particular\\nantiretroviral combinations – in a large cohort study (Sungkanuparph 2005), the fre-\\nquency of blips on an NNRTI regimen was 34% and 33% on a PI regimen, even the\\nsize of the blips were equivalent (median 140 and 144 copies/ml, respectively). In\\nboth groups, the risk of virological failure at 2 years was 8%. One important obser-\\nvation of this trial was that blips did not increase the risk of treatment failure, not\\neven on NNRTIs, anticipated due to the rapid development of resistance to NNRTIs.\\nAnother team has since confirmed these results (Martinez 2005).\\nBut what do blips actually mean? At the beginning of 2005, a study team led by Bob\\nSiliciano set out to investigate this. In a labor-intensive study (Nettles 2005), 10 stal-\\nwart patients who had had a viral load of less than 50 copies/ml for at least six\\nmonths, had blood samples taken every 2-3 days over a period of 3–4 months. The\\nobvious result: the more you look, the more you find. During the observation time,\\nat least one transient increase in the viral load was measurable above 50 copies/ml\\nin nine of the ten patients. Each blip was moderate, with a median value of \\n79 copies/ml, ranging from 51 to 201 copies/ml. The blips were not associated with\\neither specific clinical data, low plasma levels, or resistance.

In an  estimated\\nsteady state level of viral load at around 20 copies/ml, the values are distributed ran-\\ndomly. However, 96% of the randomly distributed measurements (“random noise”)\\nare less than 200 copies/ml. In other words: “Random noise” above 200 copies/ml\\nis unlikely. \\nMany factors may be responsible for intermittent viremia. It should always be kept\\nin mind that a long sample processing time may lead to apparent low-level viremia\\n(Portman 2012). Sporadic immune activation during concomitant infections may\\nelevate the level of chronically infected cells and replenish viral reservoirs, includ-\\ning the latent reservoir, providing a mechanism for recurrent viral blips and low\\nlevels of viremia while on ART (Jones 2007). In one large retrospective analysis, 26%\\nof blips were caused by intercurrent infections (Easterbrook 2002). For example,\\nsyphilis can cause a significant increase in viral load and reduction of CD4 T cells\\n(Buchacz 2004). Viral load can also increase temporarily after immunizations (Kolber\\n2002). Based on available data, blips do not necessitate an immediate change of ART.\\nHowever, caution should be applied for higher blips (>200–500 copies/ml). \\nIt should be stressed that blips need to be distinguished from low, repetitive,\\n measurable plasma viremias (“low level viremia”, LLV), in which the risk of resist-\\nance has been shown to be much higher (Gunthard 1998, Nettles 2004, Taiwo 2012).\\nHowever, every blip should raise the opportunity to talk to the patient about com-\\npliance. It cannot be discussed often enough. Does the patient take his or her drugs\\nregularly or are doses occasionally missed? Are the dosing directions (on an empty\\nstomach or with a meal) followed correctly? All these points should be considered\\nbefore changing therapy prematurely. Each new therapy can cause new problems.\\nTherefore, any suspected increase in the viral load should be controlled within a\\nshort interval (two weeks), especially if it is relatively small, before the treatment is\\nchanged.\\nImmunological treatment failure and success\\nImmunological treatment success is generally defined as an increase in the CD4 \\nT cell count. A more precise definition for immunological treatment success does\\nnot currently exist. Depending on the study, increases of 50, 100 or 200 CD4 T cells/µl\\nor increases to above 200 or 500 CD4 T cells/µl are evaluated as a success. Failure is\\nusually described as a lack of increase or reduction of CD4 T cell count in patients\\nreceiving ART.\\nIt is difficult to individually predict the immunologic success of therapy for patients\\non ART, as it varies significantly from one person to another. As with the decrease\\nin viral load, the increase in CD4 T cell count also seems to have two phases. After\\na first, usually rapid increase over the first three to four months, further increases\\nare considerably less pronounced. In a prospective study involving some\\n1000 patients, the CD4 T cell counts increased during the first three months by a\\nmedian of 21.2 cells/µl per month; in the following months the increase was only\\n5.5 cells/µl (Le Moing 2002). In EuroSIDA, the greatest mean increase in CD4 count\\nof 100 cells/µl per year was seen in the year after starting ART. Significant, but lower,\\nincreases, around 50 CD4 T cells/µl per years, were seen even at 5 years after start-\\ning ART in patients whose current CD4 T cell count was less than 500 cells/µl (Mocroft\\n2007). Of course, this might also depend where you start. If you start relatively late\\nin the disease, CD4 T cell recovery will be more blighted than if you start closer to\\ntransmission.\\nIt is still under debate whether the immune system is restored continuously after a\\nlong period of viral load suppression or whether a plateau is reached after three to\\n6.4.

In our experience, both are possible. There are patients\\nshowing immunological improvement even 6-8 years after initiation and there are\\npatients in which CD4 T cells remain stable at a low level. The lower the CD4 count\\nat baseline, the less likely it is to normalize completely (Kaufmann 2005, Robbins\\n2009). The immune system often does not recover completely. In the Swiss Cohort,\\nonly 39% of 2,235 patients who had begun ART in 1996-97 reached a CD4 T cell\\ncount above 500/µl (Kaufmann 2003). However, it appears that the increase within\\nthe first 3–6 months provides certain clues as to how well the immune system will\\nbe restored (Kaufmann 2005). Negative consequences of a low CD4 T cell count at\\nthe time of ART initiation are often present for a long time. In one study, 25% of\\npatients who started an ART at lower levels of CD4 T cell count did not reach normal\\nlevels of 500 CD4 T cells/µl, even after a decade of otherwise effective ART with good\\nviral suppression (Kelley 2009, Lok 2010).\\nImmunological treatment success is not necessarily linked to maximal viral\\n suppression; even partial suppression can result in improved CD4 T cell count\\n(Kaufmann 1998, Ledergerber 2004). The initial level of viral load is also not signif-\\nicant. What seems to be important is that the viral load remains lower than before\\ntreatment (Deeks 2002, Ledergerber 2004). In view of the numerous factors that occur\\nindependent of ART that are able to influence therapy success and individual\\nimmuno-regeneration (see below), it is generally not wise to look at the CD4 T cell\\ncount alone as the deciding criterion for the success of ART. Virological success is\\nmore appropriate for judging the efficacy of specific regimens. Once CD4 T cells have\\n“normalized” and plasma viremia remains undetectable, it is unlikely that they will\\nsignificantly change (Phillips 2002). In a newer study, patients infected with less\\nthan <200 copies/mL and CD4 T cell counts 300 cells/µl had a 99.2% probability\\nof maintaining durable 200 CD4 T-cells/µl for four years (Gale 2013). With good\\nCD4 T cells, immunological treatment success therefore does not require constant\\nmonitoring. \\nDiscordant response\\nFailure to achieve therapeutic goals – in terms of immunologic and virologic success\\n– is referred to as a discordant response.

In individual patients, clinical response is not always easy to assess. After\\nall, there is no way to show what might have occurred if treatment had not been\\nstarted. As an asymptomatic patient cannot feel much better, it may be difficult to\\nfind good arguments to continue treatment in the presence of side effects, which,\\nat least temporarily, may affect quality of life.\\nClinical success is almost always evaluated via clinical endpoints (AIDS-defining ill-\\nnesses, death), although the improvement on ART in a patient with considerable\\nconstitutional symptoms should also be seen as clinical success. With regard to risk\\nof disease progression, the immunologic response is at least as important as the viro-\\nlogic response. However, the extent of virologic success is of great significance. In\\nthe Swiss Cohort, of those with a constantly undetectable viral load, the proportion\\nof patients who went on to develop AIDS or die was 6.6% after 30 months. In con-\\ntrast, this proportion was 9% in patients with viral rebound and up to 20% if the\\nviral load was never suppressed to undetectable levels (Ledergerber 1999). The impor-\\ntance of a sustained virological treatment success for clinical benefit has also been\\nreported from other cohorts (Thiebaud 2000, Lohse 2006).\\nTable 4.2: Risk of progression, as defined by immunologic and virologic treatment response \\n(See previous table caption for definitions). 95% confidence intervals in parentheses\\nGrabar 2000 Piketty 2001 Moore 2005\\nBaseline CD4 T cells (median) 150 73 180-250\\nResponse to ART\\nVirologic and immunologic 1 1 1\\nImmunologic response only 1.6 (1.0–2.5) 6.5 (1.2–35.8) 1.9 (1.1–3.0)\\nVirologic response only 2.0 (1.3–3.1) 9.7 (1.6–58.4) 2.5 (1.5–4.0)\\nNo treatment response 3.4 (2.3–5.0) 51.0 (11.3–229.8) 3.5 (2.3–5.3)\\nClinical endpoints: progression/death (Grabar 2000, Piketty 2001), death (Moore 2005)\\nClinical failure is usually defined as the development of an AIDS-associated condi-\\ntion or death. However, illness is not always indicative of clinical treatment failure.\\nThis is particularly true for the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome\\n(IRIS), where a pre-existing, subclinical infection becomes apparent during the first\\nweeks after ART initiation (see chapter on AIDS). An OI with increased CD4 T cells\\ndoes not necessarily mean that the ART has failed, but that the immune system is\\ndoing its job, to put it in simple terms. On the other hand, if a patient develops\\nserious side effects or dies, this should clearly be evaluated as a clinical failure.\\nFortunately, this is rare. \\nTable 4.3: Causes of death in HIV+ patients in France (Morlat 2014)\\n2000 (n=964) 2005 (n=1042) 2010 (n=728)\\nAIDS-defining events 47% 36% 25%\\nNon-AIDS-defining cancers 11% 17% 22%\\nLiver diseases 13% 15% 11%\\nCardiovascular diseases 7% 8% 10%\\nSuicide 4% 5% 3%\\n6.4.

As seen there, other\\ndiseases than AIDS such as tumors or (mostly hepatic) liver diseases are becoming\\nmore important.\\nWhat can be achieved today?\\nEvery HIV clinician sees the remarkable strides made possible by ART reflected in his\\nor her own patients (see example below). In many areas, the incidence of AIDS has\\nbeen reduced to less than a tenth of what it was at its height (Mocroft 2000). Some\\nillnesses that occur only with severe immunodeficiency are rarely seen today. CMV\\nretinitis or MAC disease have become unusual. AIDS cases in Western countries occur\\nmainly in patients who are not being treated with antiretroviral therapy – usually\\nbecause they are unaware of their infection or have not acknowledged it. These so-\\ncalled late presenters now make up a large proportion of the cases of AIDS (see below).\\nIn patients who are continuously followed in specialized centers, AIDS has become\\na rare occurrence. \\nTable 4.4: Patient (female, 41 yrs old) showing remarkable advances due to ART*\\nCD4 T cells Viral load\\nFeb 95 AZT+ddC 23 (4%) NA\\nNov 96 AIDS: Toxoplasmosis, MAC, Candida esophagitis 12 (1%) 815,000\\nFeb 97 d4T+3TC+SQV 35 (8%) 500\\nJun 97 Stopped HAART due to polyneuropathy\\nJul 97 AZT+3TC+IDV 17 (4%) 141,000\\nMar 98 147 (22%) <50\\nMar 99 AZT+3TC+IDV/r+NVP 558 (24%) 100\\nMar 00 942 (31%) <50\\nApr 05 AZT+3TC+LPV/r+NVP 744 (30%) 130\\nJan 14 912 (30%) <50\\n* Excellent immune reconstitution despite severe immunodeficiency and several AIDS-defining\\nillnesses. All prophylaxes (MAC, toxoplasmosis, PCP) have been discontinued\\nIn ART-CC, a collaboration of several large cohorts, life expectancy of a 20 year-old\\nHIV+ patient increased from 36.1 to 49.4 years between 1996-1999 and 2003–2005\\n(ART-CC 2008). Life expectancy of HIV+ patients in many industrialized countries\\nis approaching that of the general population (Porter 2008, Lodwick 2010, van\\nSighem 2010, Obel 2011, Hogg 2012, Nakagawa 2012). \\nHowever, all analyses show that a gap still exists between certain patient groups\\n compared to the general population. This applies not only to patients with  hepatitis\\ncoinfection or active drug or alcohol consumption, but also to black patients or\\npatients with low CD4 T cell count when starting ART (Lohse 2007, ART-CC 2008,\\nHarrison 2010). Even in Western countries, there remain considerable differences in\\nthe overall mortality of HIV+ patients. Higher mortality rate in North American,\\ncompared with European, may be because of the inclusion of more socially\\n marginalized patients with higher mortality risk (May 2012). One of the most impor-\\ntant mortality risk for HIV+ patients in industrialized countries remains still\\n neglected: smoking. HIV+ smokers lose more life-years to smoking than to HIV.

The\\nresults seen in these studies, due to their design, led to the licensing of the PIs. In\\nABT-247, a multi-center trial, 1090 clinically advanced patients received ritonavir or\\nplacebo. The probability of AIDS and death after 29 weeks was 21.9% in the riton-\\navir arm and nearly double (37.5%) in the placebo arm (Cameron 1998). \\nStudies of mono- or dual therapy are no longer considered ethically justifiable and\\nthe number of clinical endpoints that occur is fortunately now extremely low. As a\\nresult, the duration of any contemporary study to prove clinical benefit of one com-\\nbination over another would have to be extended over a long period of time.\\nUnrealistically large study populations are now required given the extremely low\\nprobability of progression – only rarely will such investigations be undertaken in the\\nfuture (Raffi 2001). Two of the few trials that could confirm the benefits of ART on\\nclinical endpoints were the SMART and the START trial (see sections 6.5 and 6.10). \\nHowever, all large cohorts such as EuroSIDA, the Swiss Cohort and the US HOPS\\nCohort have clearly shown the benefit of ART (Table 4.5). The Swiss Cohort showed\\nthat the effect of ART increases over time – after more than two years on ART, the\\nrisk of disease progression was only 4% of the risk without ART (Sterne 2005).\\nNumerous cohort studies have shown that during recent years there has been no\\nfurther decline in AIDS and mortality rates. It seems that, in many patients, ART is\\nsimply begun too late. Even in 2006, almost half of the patients initiating ART have\\nless than 200 CD4 T cells/µl (May 2006). \\nTable 4.5: Decline in morbidity and mortality in large cohorts \\nWhere (n) Patients (Period) Mortality Morbidity\\n(/100 PY) (/100 PY)\\nPalella USA <100 CD4 T cells/μl 29.4 → 8.8 21.9 → 3.7*\\n1998 (1,255) (1994–97)\\nLedergerber Switzerland (2,410) 6 months before versus NA 15.1 → 7.7\\n1999 3 months after ART (1995-97)\\nMocroft Europe (7,331) All (1994–98) NA 30.7 → 2.5\\n2000\\nMocroft Europe (8,556) All (1994–2001) 15.6 → 2.7 NA\\n2002\\nD’ Arminio Worldwide (12,574) The first 3 months after NA 12.9 → 1.3\\n2005 versus 3 years after ART\\nD:A:D 2010 Worldwide (33,308) All (1999–2007) 1.7 → 1.0 NA\\n* MAC, PCP , CMV.

The most obvious is the\\ndecline in the incidence of viral OIs, although this is not as pronounced for fungal\\ninfections (D’Arminio 2005). With regard to opportunistic infections and malig-\\nnancies, the effect of ART is equally apparent on their clinical course as it is on their\\nincidence. Illnesses such as cryptosporidiosis or PML can be cured, while Kaposi\\nsarcoma can resolve completely without specific therapy. Prophylaxis of pneumo-\\ncystis pneumonia, toxoplasmic encephalitis, CMV , or MAC infection can usually be\\nsafely withdrawn at the adequate CD4 counts.

Treatment goal: “HIV cure”\\nGEORG BEHRENS, CHRISTIAN HOFFMANN \\nThe cure of HIV-infected patients remains the holy grail of HIV medicine. With the\\nintroduction of combination ART it has been calculated that the calculated time to\\neradication of all reservoirs is 70 years. Thus, it is clear that strategies beyond the\\ncurrent ART regimen will be necessary. Many researchers share the opinion that a\\ncure has to be the major goal for the future.\\nThe cure of the so-called Berlin patient Timothy Brown, published in 2008, shows\\nthat a cure is at least theoretically possible. Brown had suffered from acute myeloid\\nleukemia and underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The healthy stem cell\\ndonor was homozygous for the /H900432 mutation, a genetic defect leading to the absence\\nof CCR5 co-receptor from his cells – after the transplant the viral load of in the Berlin\\npatient (which was very high before ART initiation) has disappeared for at least four\\nyears (Hütter 2009, Allers 2011, Symons 2014). The virus was undetectable in the\\nblood, in the lymph nodes and in the intestinal mucosa (Yukl 2013), suggesting that\\ntargeted CCR5 disruption can lead to an HIV cure. There is no doubt that in clini-\\ncal practice, an allogeneic stem cell transplant is not an appropriate way for a HIV\\ncure (Cillo 2013). It is not only complicated and expensive, but also highly risky\\n(mortality up to 30%), making this approach not very practical (Zhou 2013).\\nHowever, although not reproducible until today, the case of the Berlin patient stirred\\nhope for future academic purposes.\\nSterilizing or functional cure?\\nEradication of all viruses from the body would be the definitive cure. But is this really\\nnecessary? Much would have been achieved if the immune system is able to control\\nHIV without help of medication – i.e., in some viral infections, like herpes, low viral\\nlevels persist for a lifetime. This is why a difference is being made today between a\\n“sterilizing cure” and “functional cure” (Reviews: Richman 2009, Lewin 2011). A\\nfunctional cure is achieved in the so called “post treatment controllers” (PTC), in\\nwhom viremia remained controlled for several years after the interruption of ART.\\nCurrently at least four strategies are being pursued and partly combined. These are\\n1. Eradication of latently infected cells and 2. Eradication of residual replication, as\\nwell as 3. Improvement of the HIV-specific immune response and 4. Attempts to\\nmake cells more resistant against HIV infection. \\nA few patients have already reached functional cure. These so-called “elite con-\\ntrollers”, some found in most large HIV centers, have normal CD4 T cells for many\\nyears and even more impressive, a viral load below the limit of detection without\\ntherapy. Only when investigating with ultrasensitive methods or examining the\\nlymph nodes can a relatively tiny amount of virus be found. Co-receptor defects\\nexplain only a few of the cases, and efficient antiviral immunity capable of con-\\ntrolling HIV reaction was observed occasionally (Smith 2015) (see Pathogenesis). \\nHowever, despite maintaining very low levels of plasma viremia, elite controllers\\nhave elevated immune activation and accelerated atherosclerosis. In a prospective\\ntrial, controllers had a statistically significant decrease in ultrasensitive plasma and\\nrectal HIV RNA levels with ART (Hatano 2013). Moreover, markers of T cell activa-\\ntion/dysfunction in blood and gut mucosa also decreased substantially with ART.\\nSimilar reductions were observed in the subset of “elite” controllers with pre-ART\\nplasma HIV RNA levels below conventional assays (<40 copies/mL). These observa-\\ntions raise the question whether a functional cure is comparable to well-tolerated\\nART and whether the degree of HIV suppression in elite controllers is equivalent to\\nthat achieved by ART when it comes to clinical outcomes.\\n158 ART'),\n",

This infant had been antiretrovirally treated only 31 hours after birth (Persaud\\n2013). The baseline viral load of 19,812 copies/ml felt down to 265 copies/ml at day\\n19 and was then undetectable for 18 months. The baby was then lost to the health\\ncare system for the next six months. Unexpectedly, the viral suppression remained\\nundetectable when tested for HIV upon return. More than two years this girl had no\\nsigns of the virus in her blood despite cessation of treatment. An ultrasensitive assay\\nrevealed 4 copies HIV-DNA/million PBMCs but no HIV-specific immune responses.\\nProtective HLA types as seen in elite controllers were not observed. The finding\\nencouraged scientists hoping to find a way to save children from a lifetime of ART.\\nHowever, the virus resurfaced in the patient 27 months after ART stopped (Ledford\\n2014). It became obvious that the “post-treatment control” had only been transient.\\nIt remains unclear what led to the abrupt rebound. Moreover, similar pediatric cases\\nwere published in which virologic rebound occurred within days of discontinuation\\nof ART, despite immediate treatment after delivery (Butler 2015).\\nAlso in 2013, PTC cases had been published from France (Sáez-Cirión 2013). In the\\nso-called VISCONTI cohort (Viro-Immunological Sustained CONtrol after Treatment\\nInterruption), 14 HIV+ patients were reported in which prolonged ART had been\\n initiated within the first 35–70 days post infection. Viremia remained controlled (less\\nthan 500 copies/ml) for a median of 7.5 years after treatment interruption. Most of\\nthese PTCs lacked the protective HLA B alleles that are overrepresented in elite con-\\ntrollers. Thus, it seems that early and prolonged ART may allow some individuals\\nwith a rather unfavorable background to achieve long-term infection control. Further\\nstudies from France and Thailand also demonstrated that the viral reservoir remains\\nlimited with early ART (Hocqueloux 2013, Ananworanich 2013). But how often does\\ntreatment of primary HIV infection lead to post-treatment control? Unfortunately,\\nit remained unclear how many patients in total were included in the VISCONTI\\ncohort. Forteen patients out of 100, 1,000, 10,000? More recent data suggest a low\\nlikelihood of PTC even when ART is started within 12 weeks of HIV-1 infection\\n(Maenza 2015).\\nMoreover, the hitherto largest randomized trial in this field yielded only moderate\\nsuccess of early ART (SPARTAC 2013). A total of 366 patients with primary HIV infec-\\ntion (less than 6 months after seroconversion) were randomized for 12–48 weeks\\nART or to remain untreated. A 48-week course of ART delayed disease progression\\nwhich was defined as CD4 T cells of less than 350 cells/µl or long-term ART initia-\\ntion. However, there were no significant differences in the incidence of AIDS, death,\\nor serious adverse events and the delay in disease progression was lost soon after\\nART interruption. Although the risk/benefit of initiating ART in primary HIV infec-\\ntion remains a matter of discussion (Lodi 2012, Jain 2013), once a decision for ART\\nhas been made, therapy should be continued (see also chapter on acute infection).\\nA cure in chronically infected patients?\\nThe acute HIV infection is rarely diagnosed. The main question is what can be\\nachieved in patients with chronic infection. Several barriers to a cure in these patients\\nhave to be overcome (Katlama 2013), such as the intrinsic stability of the viral genome\\nin latently infected cells such as long-lived memory T cells, and the sustained  low-\\nlevel viral replication in different compartments. Not to mention severe metholog-\\nical problems measuring the latent reservoir. It remains unclear what should be\\n measured in which cells with which tools (Siliciano 2013). \\nProviral DNA measured by PCR from PBMC detects much more (300-fold) provirus\\n6.4.

These defec-\\ntive proviruses are detected by PCR but may not require eradication to accomplish\\nan effective cure. Less than 1% of proviruses are induced to release infectious virus\\nafter maximum in vitro activation. However, analysis of a large number of proviral\\nclones from treated patients showed 12% with intact genomes and normal long\\n terminal repeat (LTR) function, indicating that they may become activated in vivo\\n(Ho 2013). A better understanding of the discrepancy between infected cell\\n frequencies measured by viral outgrowth versus PCR assays is an urgent priority in\\nHIV cure research (Eriksson 2013).\\nThe latent reservoirs\\nAt this point in time, eradication of HIV , the removal of all HIV from the body, is a\\ntheoretical goal. The main reason is that latently HIV-infected cells comprise a life-\\nlong reservoir (Saksena 2003). Even after years of suppression, viral transcription can\\nbe detected (Finzi 1999, Furtado 1999, Sigal 2011). This is particularly true in blood\\ncells, but also in the lymph nodes and in sperm (Lafeuillade 2001, Nunnari 2002),\\nwhere HIV may persist hiding from immune recognition (Fukazawa 2015).\\nReplication also takes place in cells of the gastrointestinal tract, even if no virus is\\ndetected in the blood. Even after myoablative chemotherapy and autologous stem\\ncell transplantation, latent reservoirs persist (Cillo 2013). After stopping ART in such\\npatients, a rebound is seen rapidly (Henrich 2013+2014), and possibly occurs at\\n multiple sites (Rothenberger 2015). In addition, latently infected reservoirs consist\\nof very heterogenic cell populations, among the T memory and stem cells (Buzon\\n2014). The stability of these cells is probably independent of residual virus replication.\\nTheoretically, how long does it take until the last latently infected cells are removed?\\nA half-life of 44.2 months for the latently infected cell reservoir was measured in a\\nstudy with 62 patients, whose viral load had been successfully suppressed on ART\\nfor a period of seven years (Siliciano 2003). The calculated time to eradication of\\nthese reservoirs was 73.4 years. Even in patients with no measurable blips during at\\nleast three years of stable ART and with a tendency for a more rapid decrease of viral\\nload, the time to eradication was 51.2 years. Virus in resting CD4 memory cells with\\nminimal evolution persists, even after close to 9 years on ART (Nottet 2009).\\nMoreover, recent research suggest that the latent reservoir is larger than previously\\nthought (Dolgin 2013). \\nIntensification strategies\\nMany studies have investigated whether viral decay rates can be improved or whether\\nany change at all can be effected by intensifying therapy. Different strategies were tried,\\nsuch as additional administration of integrase or entry inhibitors, but also of other\\ncompounds to try to to empty the latent reservoirs. These studies are discussed below.\\nMega-HAART, entry and/or integrase inhibitors \\nIn a trial with patients with good viral suppression and additional PIs or NNRTIs in\\ntheir ART, an ultrasensitive single copy assay showed no further reduction of viral\\nload by intensification (Dinoso 2009). The level of viral load depends not so much\\non the applied regime, but on on the pre-therapeutical setpoint (Maldarelli 2007).\\nAdditional administration of the entry inhibitor T-20 did not show any effects either\\n(Ghandi 2010). Resting T cells are also not affected by T-20 nor by a combination\\nwith valproic acid (Archin 2010).\\n160 ART'),\n",

One study showed no relevant effects on the\\nlatent reservoirs (Puertas 2014) and other studies showed no or even unfavorable\\neffects on immune activation (Sauzullo 2010, Wilkin 2010, Hunt 2013). One study\\nwith acutely infected patients showed hardly any effect either on virologic or\\nimmunologic parameters (Evering 2010). Another carefully designed study with \\n40 patients with acute HIV infection compared a triple regime plus raltegravir plus\\nmaraviroc with a classic triple regimen. Intensive therapy showed no advantages\\nregarding residual viremia or the degree of immune reconstitution or immune acti-\\nvation (Markowitz 2014). Obviously it is not a question of the number of ARVs.\\nHopes for additional effects of the integrase inhibitor raltegravir were raised by a\\nstudy in which treatment-naïve patients on a raltegravir regimen achieved a viral\\nload below detection significantly more rapidly than those on efavirenz (Murray\\n2007). Several prospective studies in which raltegravir was added to an existing ART\\nshowed no additional antiviral effect by means of ultrasensitive viral load assays\\n(Gandhi 2009, MacMahon 2010, Gandhi 2012). Immune activation was also not\\ninfluenced by raltegravir (Luna 2009, Massanella 2011). Results are contradictory\\nregarding the question of whether proviral DNA decreases more rapidly. While two\\nsmall studies showed positive effects (Arponen 2008, Reigadas 2010), several larger\\nstudies did not confirm these results (Buzon 2010, Hatano 2011, Chege 2012). \\nSeveral studies showed an increase of episomal DNA while on raltegravir. This DNA,\\nalso referred to as 2-long terminal repeat (2-LTR) circular, develops when integrase\\ninhibitors block the DNA integration process into the chromatin. Evidence of this\\nepisomal DNA (2-LTR circles) in approximately 30% of patients receiving raltegravir\\nplus effective ART, shows that an active viral increase was stopped (Buzon 2010,\\nReigadas 2010, Llibre 2012, Hatano 2013). A recent study, however, found no\\nincreased 2-LTR circles during raltegravir intensification (Besson 2012). Another\\nstudy demonstrated that resting CD4 T cells were not achieved with raltegravir or\\nwith a combination that included valproic acid (Archin 2010) (see below). Sites such\\nas the CNS or gut are not influenced (Yukl 2010, Lee 2011, Yilmaz 2011). \\n“Kick and Kill” or reservoir eradicators \\nAs shown above, it is very doubtful that eradication is possible with currently avail-\\nable regimens (Shen 2008, Lewin 2011). Intensification or extension to a four- or\\nfive-drug therapy has not had meaningful results. Therefore, the old “Kick and Kill”\\nstrategy is being revived, in which infected cells are first activated in hope of them\\nbeing recognized by the immune system and killed more rapidly (Deeks 2012). \\nSeveral attempts to empty viral reservoirs using different methods (IL-2, hydroxyurea\\nor OKT) have not been successful (Kulkosky 2002, Pomerantz 2002). A pilot study\\non valproic acid, an epileptic drug, caused a stir in the summer of 2005. Implemented\\nas an inhibitor of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC), it suggested a clearance of HIV from\\nresting T cells (Lehrmann 2005). In three out of four patients the number of infected\\nresting CD4 T cells decreased significantly and half-life was reduced to 2-3 months\\ncompared to other studies showing a longer half-life of 44 months on ART (Siciliano\\n2003). Smaller follow-up studies (Steel 2006, Siliciano 2007, Archin 2010) did not\\nconfirm these results. More recently, a randomized crossover study finally put an end\\nto the discussion, showing no effect at all of valproic acid in 56 patients (Routy 2010). \\nWith the end of valproate, more selective and possibly more potent HDAC inhibitors\\nare being investigated. Results are conflicting (Archin 2012, Blazkova 2012).\\nVorinostat, an agent that has been approved as a treatment of malignant mesothe-\\nlioma, was active in one study in vivo (Archin 2012) but failed to do so in another\\n(Elliott 2013). Vorinostat was able to increase HIV transcription (“kick”), but without\\n6.4. Goals and principles of therapy    161'),\n",

Romidepsin seems to be\\nmore effective (Wei 2013, Søgaard 2014) and is tested as well as panobinostat and\\nother HDACi (Edelstein 2009, Rasmussen 2013). Further chemical classes able to acti-\\nvate latent infected cells are quinolone derivatives (Xing 2012) protein phosphatase-\\n1 targeting compounds (Tyagi 2015) or disulfiram (Spival 2012). \\nIt may be necessary to activate HIV-specific CTLs (Shan 2012, Deng 2014) for the\\n“kill” part. There are attempts with therapeutical vaccines that simultaneously\\nimprove HIV-specific immune response (Garcia 2012). Recently it was shown that\\nacutely infected patients retain a broad-spectrum viral-specific CTL response and that\\nappropriate boosting of this response may be required for the elimination of the\\nlatent reservoir (Deng 2015).\\nAttempts with immunoglobins (Lindkvist 2009) or broadly neutralizing antibodies\\nare also being postulated. Even the old substance interferon is being discussed again\\nas an immune modulator (Sandler 2014). In one study 9 out of 20 patients receiv-\\ning pegylated interferon during a HAART interruption, demonstrated viral load levels\\nbelow 400 copies/ml after 12 weeks of IFN monotherapy (Azzoni 2013). \\nGentherapeutic approaches are also under investigation. In a pilot trial, the infusion\\nof autologous, gene-modified CD4 T cells in which the CCR5 gene was rendered per-\\nmanently dysfunctional by a zinc-finger nuclease was safe (Tebas 2014). The observed\\nrelative survival advantage of the gene-modified cells during treatment interruption\\nsuggests that genome editing at the CCR5 locus confers a selective advantage to CD4\\nT cells in patients infected with HIV. Many more approaches are under investiga-\\ntion, the most promising among them are: \\na) zinc-finger nucleases that can efficiently excise integrated HIV-1 from the human\\ngenome in infected cells \\nb) “designer” T cells that can target and kill HIV Env-expressing cells and thus\\nimprove the HIV-specific immune response (Sahu 2013, Yang 2014) \\nc) induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies that can effectively suppress viremia\\nin untreated patients (Horwitz 2013).\\nSummary:\\nAn HIV cure is not around the corner. Within the next years, we will see more and\\nmore patients classified as post-treatment controllers or “functionally cured”.\\nHowever, this will apply only to a small group of patients. Latently infected cells\\ndiffer minutely from non-infected cells, which cannot be easily discerned via those\\nmethods available in most clinics. They are also non-specific. Washing out the reser-\\nvoirs or eliminating all the infected memory cells has either been unsuccessful or\\ntoo toxic. Removing the HIV genome from infected cells with special recombinants\\nhas been successful in the laboratory and in the animal model (Hauber 2013); but\\nthere is still a long way to go before this can be used in the clinic (Sarkar 2007).\\nGiven the complexity of the immune system which is far away from being com-\\npletely understood, a solution for the majority of the patients is a distant prospect. \\nReferences \\nAllers K, Hütter G, Hofmann J, et al.

When to start ART\\nCHRISTIAN HOFFMANN \\nSince the introduction of ART, practice of treatment initiation is ever-changing.\\nFacing encouraging results with early AZT in 1995, David Ho initiated the slogan\\n“hit hard, hit early”, and almost all clinicians were taking him at his word. However,\\nover the following years it became obvious that the tolerability of first generation\\nART regimens was poor. Patients complained about high pill burden and physicians\\nbecame more defensive. There was controversial debate about the best time for ini-\\ntiation and the indication for antiretroviral therapy was based on clinical assessment,\\nCD4 T cell count and viral load. The risk of AIDS and other HIV-associated compli-\\ncations had to be weighed against the risks of long-term toxicity and viral resistance.\\nIn Europe, the median CD4 T cell count at initiation of ART was only 200/µl in the\\nfirst years of the last decade, after being 270/µl in 1998 (May 2006). \\nIn more recent years, the pendulum has been swinging back. With regard to new\\ndrugs that are more potent and better to tolerate, there is a strong trend towards\\nearlier treatment initiation. In 2007/2008, most guidelines have determined that a\\nCD4 T cell count of <350 cells/µl, instead of 200 cells/µl, is the definitive threshold\\nfor initiation of ART in all asymptomatic patients. During the last years, the thresh-\\nold was raised up to 500 cells/µl in many guidelines (US/WHO). However, patients\\nin resource-limited countries are still starting their ART at CD4 cells lower than 200/µl\\n(Mugglin 2012). \\nFacing the early results of the landmark START trial published in May 2015 (see\\nbelow), the discussion whether and when to start ART may come to an end. The\\nquestion “When to start ART” may change to “Why not yet started ART?”. There is\\nno doubt that current guidelines in the USA and (especially in) Europe (see Table 5.1.)\\nwill be modified again in the near future. \\nGuidelines are not set in stone. Decisions must still be made on a case-by-case basis.\\nIn some cases, therapy might (or even should) be deferred. Last but not least, the\\npatient should be ready to start. Experience as well as some intuition of the treating\\nphysician is mandatory.\\nTable 5.1: Recommendations from various guidelines on when to initiate therapy\\nClinical CD4 T cells/μl Initiation of HAART is...\\nCDC B+C All values “Is always recommended” (DHHS, EACS)\\nCDC A <350 “Is always recommended” (DHHS, EACS)\\nCDC A 350-500 “Is recommended” (rating: strong) (DHSS)\\n“Should be considered in asymptomatic patients, recommended\\nin patients with several conditions like hepatitis coinfection, \\nmalignant or renal diseases, high risk of cardiovascular/malignant\\ndiseases” (EACS)\\nCDC A >500 “Is recommended (rating: moderate) in asymptomatic \\npatients, recommended (rating: strong) in patients with \\nhepatitis coinfection, renal and other diseases” (DHSS)\\n“Should be considered in asymptomatic patients, \\nrecommended if one of the points listed in 350–500 apply” (EACS)\\nDHHS: US Department of Health and Human Services.

This was shown by an analysis of\\n13 cohort studies from Europe and North America including 9,323 adult treatment-\\nnaïve patients who started ART with a combination of at least three drugs. At 6\\nmonths after starting ART, the current CD4 T cell count and viral load, but not values\\nat baseline, were strongly associated with subsequent disease progression (Chene\\n2003). \\nTo evaluate the individual risk for a treatment-naïve patient, one can check www.art-\\ncohort-collaboration.org (May 2007). Only a few parameters are needed. It is also\\npossible to calculate the risk after 6 months on ART.\\nPractical experiences \\nEven if the indication for ART seems obvious or even urgent, it should be clarified\\nwhether the patient is indeed prepared to start treatment (treatment readiness). The\\nproblem is not necessarily the initiation of ART, but the longer-term maintenance.\\nThe decision to initiate treatment is often made prematurely. It is usually unwise to\\nprescribe lifelong medication to a patient in the very first consultation. One should\\nfirst attain an overall picture of the patient, and try to get to know something about\\nlifestyle and motives – why they have come to see a doctor and what they expect.\\nOn the other hand, the patient’s wish to start therapy should be respected. If after\\na detailed discussion a well-informed patient wants to begin treatment, even though\\nthe results justify waiting, ART should not be withheld. For many patients, treat-\\nment can be a psychological support. Not everybody can sleep peacefully at night\\nknowing that inside them a hundred million new viruses are being produced every\\nday and a huge number of helper cells are being destroyed. \\nHowever, if a vacation is planned, it may be better to delay therapy, so that treat-\\nment response and side effects can be adequately monitored. On the other hand,\\npatients may sometimes find one reason after another (stress at work, exams, change\\nof job, etc) to delay initiation of treatment. Many patients are afraid of AIDS, but\\noften just as afraid of ART (“the pills are the beginning of the end!”). They may have\\nirrational or simply false expectations of ART and its consequences – starting therapy\\ndoes not mean that one will be subjected to daily infusions and no longer able to\\nwork. Therapy should be explained to every patient from the outset. It is also useful\\nto define individual threshold values for the commencement of therapy with patients\\nearly on, so that therapy is started only when these levels are reached. In our expe-\\nrience, patients who are not ready at the moment are more motivated by this\\napproach.\\nAs a rule, as much time as is needed should be taken for the decision to start therapy.\\nWe recommend that patients come for several consultations to get prepared for treat-\\nment. There are two exceptions: acute HIV infection (see chapter on Acute Infection)\\nand severe immunodeficiency. However, even in the presence of most AIDS-defin-\\ning conditions, the acute disease should often be treated first before initiating ART,\\nas the potential for complications with TB, PCP, toxoplasmosis or CMV therapies\\nunnecessarily jeopardize treatment options. In asymptomatic patients with very low\\nCD4 T cells, it makes sense to start first with a PCP prophylaxis. Over the next (few)\\ndays, one can perform an exam (X-ray, ultrasound, fundoscopy, etc) and check the\\npatient’s readiness. Does the patient come back? Are they really motivated? \\n168 ART'),\n",

And is\\nquality of life really better without ART? In the SMART study quality of life was worse\\nwithout. Remember also that in an observational cohort collaboration study on\\n34,384 ART-naive individuals, the mean CD4 T cell decline was -78 (95% CI, -80 to\\n-76) cells/µl per year. The decline was strongly associated with a higher current viral\\nload: for every 1 log10 copies/ml higher, CD4 T cells declined by an additional \\n37.6 cells/µl per year (COHERE 2014). This means that even a patient with 700 CD4\\nT cells/µl will reach the thresholds of 350 or 500/µl within a few years. How much\\nlong-term toxicity is really saved by two or maybe even five years without ART expo-\\nsure when lifelong ART will be given over decades? Will this exposure reduction be\\nrelevant in the older ages of this patient? Will it be relevant in the year 2050 that\\nhe had initiated ART in 2016 or 2018? Probably not. Talk with him. A well informed\\npatient will adhere better.\\nAsymptomatic patients, >350 CD4 cells/μl\\nBelow 350 CD4 T cells/µl, there is broad consensus that all asymptomatic patients\\nshould initiate ART. But even above this threshold, ART should be considered.\\nAlthough rather low, in the long run the risk of developing AIDS cannot be excluded.\\nThere is no reason to think the patient 100% safe, even at very high CD4 T cells. A\\nlook at the calculation presented above (May 2007), gives a rough idea about the\\nindividual risk. After ART initiation, a 45 year-old asymptomatic patient with 200–\\n350 CD4 T cells/µl, a viral load below 100,000 copies/ml has an AIDS mortality risk\\nof 3.1% after one year, and 8.7% after five years. Starting ART above 350 CD4 \\nT cells/µl, reduces the risk to 2.0% and 7.3% for the same patient. Such a reduction\\nof just 1 or 2% may seem insignificant at first.

Although the trial’s primary\\nendpoint was HIV transmission, preliminary results showed that the numbers of\\nsevere diseases and death were significantly lower in the group starting ART imme-\\ndiately (57 versus 77, p=0.07). With regard to AIDS cases, the difference was signif-\\nicant (40 versus 61, p=0.03).

Whereas in the\\nUS early treatment was of clinical benefit (Kitahata 2009), this was not observed in\\nEurope (Sterne 2009). It seems obvious, that the hitherto largest trial, the START\\nstudy, will end this debate (START 2015). In this study, worldwide 4,685 patients\\nwith more than 500 CD4 T cells/µl (median 651/µl, median viral load 12,759\\ncopies/ml) were randomized to initiate ART immediately or to wait until CD4 T cells\\ndeclined to below 350 CD4 cells/µl or until symptoms appeared. The ART regimen\\nwas chosen by the treating physician. The primary composite end point was any\\nserious AIDS-related event, serious non-AIDS-related event, or death from any cause.\\nIn May 2015, the data and safety monitoring board recommended that patients in\\nthe deferred-initiation group be offered antiretroviral therapy. In the immediate ini-\\ntiation group the composite primary end point was reached in significantly fewer\\npatients than in the deferred initiation group (42 versus 96 events, p <0.0001). The\\nclinical endpoints are shown in the Table 5.4.\\nTable 5.4: Clinical endpoints in the START study, numbers per 100 person-years (absolute numbers) \\nImmediate ART Deferred ART Hazard Ratio P Value\\n(n=2,326) (n=2,359) (95% CI)\\nDeath from any cause 0.17 (12) 0.30 (21) 0.58 (0.28–1.17) 0.13\\nSerious non-AIDS-related event 0.42 (29) 0.67 (47) 0.61 (0.38–0.97) 0.04\\nSerious AIDS-related event 0.20 (14) 0.72 (50) 0.28 (0.15–0.50) <0.001\\nTB 0.09 (6) 0.28 (20) 0.29 (0.12–0.73) 0.008\\nKaposi sarcoma 0.01 (1) 0.16 (11) 0.09 (0.01–0.71) 0.02\\nMalignant lymphoma 0.04 (3) 0.14 (10) 0.30 (0.08–1.10) 0.07\\nCancer not related to AIDS 0.13 (9) 0.26 (18) 0.50 (0.22–1.11) 0.09\\nAs can be seen, the benefit was mainly driven by a reduction of TB, KS and lym-\\nphoma incidence.

Questions about beginning an optimal\\ntherapy are superfluous as these patients are more or less classified as urgent. There\\nis no consensus regarding the definition of “late presenter”. In most cases, a CD4-\\ncell count below 200/µl and/or a manifest AIDS disease at the time of HIV diagno-\\nsis will do. Some authors also classify the groups “late testers”, “very late presenters”\\nand even “long-term non-presenters”. At the second “HIV in Europe” conference in\\nNovember 2009, it was agreed that those patients with a CD4 cell count below 350/µl\\nat initial presentation are to be referred to as late presenters (Antinori 2011). In the\\nUS and Europe they still constitute more than half of all patients (Althoff 2011,\\nMocroft 2013).  \\nIncidence and risk factors of a late HIV diagnosis\\nHow frequent are late presenters? In COHERE, a collaboration of observational HIV\\ncohorts in Europe, among 84,524 individuals from 23 cohorts in 35 countries, 53.8%\\nwere classified late presenters. The rate decreased only moderately from 57.3% in\\n2000 to 51.7% in 2010/2011 (Mocroft 2013). Lacking an overall valid definition,\\nrates between 10-44% are currently being reported in different European countries\\nand the US with a recently slightly downward trend (Table 5.5). Several studies have\\nlooked at the risk factors of late diagnosis (Table 5.6). The characteristics (advanced\\nage, migrant origin, heterosexual transmission, see above) indicate more complex\\nreasons for a late diagnosis. \\nThey probably involve patients (less access to health system, lack of information,\\nfear of stigmatization), as well as doctors and members of the health care system\\n(among others lack of HIV awareness with certain patient groups). Several studies\\nenforce the notion that, even with high-risk patients, many chances of diagnosing\\nHIV at an earlier stage are missed (Duffus 2009, Jenness 2009). As much as 76% of\\n263 African patients living in London had visited a general doctor a year before HIV\\nwas diagnosed. Of note, 38% were in outpatient care and 15% had received  inpatient\\ntreatment in the year before HIV diagnosis (Burns 2008).\\nTable 5.5: Frequency of late diagnosis in Europe  \\nCountry Period Definition of late % (ADE) Trend over time\\n(n) diagnosis\\nItaly 1992–2006 CD4 <200 cells/μl 39 (24) Decline from\\n(Borghi 2008) (884) or AIDS <3 Mo 43 to 35%\\nFrance 1996–2006 CD4 <200 cells/μl 38 (17) Decline from\\n(Delpierre 2008) (6.805) or AIDS <1 year 43 to 32%\\nSpain 1987–2006 AIDS <3 months (44) Not stated\\n(Carnicer 2009) (6.186) \\nGreat Britain 2008 CD4 <200 cells/μl 32 Not stated\\n(HPA 2009) (7.218)\\nUSA 1996–05 CD4 <200 cells/μl 38 Decline from\\n(CDC 2009) (281.421) or AIDS <1 year 43 to 36%\\nGreat Britain 1996–2006 CD4 <200 cells/μl 27 (10) Not stated\\n(UK Chic 2010) (15.775) \\nSwitzerland 1998–2007 CD4  <200 cells/μl 31 No clear trend\\n(Wolbers 2009) (1.915)\\nADE = AIDS-defining event\\n6.5.

This applies greatly to classical opportunistic infections such as PCP or\\nCMV retinitis, but also to tuberculosis or Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (ART-CC 2009).\\nIn the German Lymphoma Cohort, two-thirds of patients with newly diagnosed NHL\\nhad not previously received ART. 40% of patients with AIDS, a group associated with\\nthe highest mortality rate even today, are diagnosed with NHL and HIV infection\\nsimultaneously (Hoffmann 2009). In a British analysis counting 387 deaths of HIV+\\npatients in the years 2004/2005, as many as 24% of all deaths and 35% of HIV/AIDS-\\nrelated deaths were ascribed to a late HIV diagnosis (Lucas 2008). An account analy-\\nsis showed that, treating expenditures increased by 200% with less than 200 CD4 \\nT cells at the time of HIV diagnosis (Krentz 2004). This may be attributed to the\\nimmune reconstitution syndrome (IRIS) frequently observed in late presenters (see\\nchapter on AIDS).\\nThere is no doubt that a late HIV diagnosis is associated with higher mortality and\\nmorbidity risk. The risk increases with lower CD4 T cells at therapy initiation (Egger\\n2002, Sterne 2009). An analysis of therapy-naïve patients in three major European\\ncohort trials observed 8.3 new AIDS cases per 100 patient years in patients with less\\nthan 200 CD4 cells/µl at the beginning of therapy – and only 1.8/100 patient years\\nin those with at least 350 CD4 T cells/µl. The mortality rate was slightly higher with\\n2.9 versus 0.7/100 (Phillips 2001). Several other cohort trials also found a clear\\n association between CD4 T cells at therapy initiation and AIDS and mortality rates\\n(Cozzi-Lepri 2001, Kaplan 2003, Palella 2003, Braitstein 2006, Mocroft 2013). The\\nlesser the CD4 T cell count, the higher the risk for the following time period, over\\nmany years (Lanoy 2007). Increased mortality remains with very low rates (less than\\n25 CD4 T cells/µl) even six years after starting ART and maybe longer (ART-CC 2007).\\nA complete reconstitution of the immune system is rarely the case if the patient’s\\ninitial situation is poor – the worse the immune system, the more unlikely a com-\\nplete recovery (Garcia 2004, Kaufmann 2005, Gras 2007). Viral suppression over\\nseveral years cannot change that. In a study with patients on ART showing a con-\\nstant low viral load below 1000 copies/ml for at least 4 years, 44% of patients with\\nless than 100 CD4 cells/µl at initiation of ART failed to reach 500 CD4 T cells/µl\\neven after 7.5 years. Patients with 100-200 CD4 T cells/µl still showed a risk of immune\\nnon-recovery of 25% (Kelley 2009). In our own study, a low CD4 T cell nadir remained\\nassociated with a lower CD4 cell recovery even after 15 years (Erdbeer 2014).\\nAnother risk factor, besides low CD4 T cells, is advanced age, which has been observed\\n172 ART'),\n",

The ability to regenerate the immune system\\ndecreases with age and is probably caused by degeneration of the thymus (Lederman\\n2000, Viard 2001, Grabar 2004). A consequence of a late start of ART can also mean\\nthat the antigen-specific immune reconstitution against HIV , as well as opportunis-\\ntic viruses, remain poor. Many studies suggest that the qualitative immune recon-\\nstitution cannot keep up with the quantitative (Gorochov 1998, Lange 2002). But\\nwhy does the risk of AIDS drop so dramatically with rising CD4 T cell count? How\\ncan patients with severe immunosuppression safely discontinue a prophylaxis, as\\nsoon as their CD4 T cell count is above 200/µl? Clinical observations seem to show\\ndifferently, at least for the time being.\\nHowever, the relevance of a limited immune constitution in the long run is not yet\\nclear. Recent data from the ClinSurv Cohort suggests that a discordant response (low\\nCD4 T cells in spite of good viral suppression) is only associated with higher AIDS\\nrisk in the first few months. With virally well-suppressed patients, the CD4 T cells\\nare no longer a good surrogate marker for risk of AIDS (Zoufaly 2009).\\nIn contrast to the immunologic response, virologic response in combination with\\npoor starting conditions is generally not worse than with other patients. Nevertheless,\\n89% out of 760 patients with AIDS at HIV diagnosis showed a viral load below \\n500 copies/ml after initiating ART (Mussini 2008).\\nWhen to start ART in Late Presenters?\\nPatients with a poor immunological state should begin ART quickly. This recom-\\nmendation applies for CDC stage C (AIDS-defining diseases) and for all stage B\\n diseases. However, it has not yet been agreed on how quickly one should start ART\\nwithin the context of an acute opportunistic infection (OI). Up to now, many ther-\\napists preferred to tend to the acute disease first and to wait a few weeks before begin-\\nning ART. They hoped to avoid the unnecessary high complication potential of OI\\ntherapies. The first randomized trial addressing this idea has made this strategy\\n questionable (Zolopa 2009). In ACTG A5164, 282 patients with acute OI (63% PCP,\\ncases of tuberculosis were omitted) were randomized to start ART either immediately\\nor at earliest time after completing OI therapy. On average, the “immediate” group\\nstarted ART 12 days after initiation of OI therapy, whereas the “later” treated group\\nafter 45 days. Although the intervals were not so wide apart, distinct differences\\ncould be observed after 48 weeks: the group treated immediately showed signifi-\\ncantly less fatalities and less new cases of AIDS. The risk to have to adjust ART was\\nslightly higher, but not the number of severe undesired incidents, hospitalization or\\ncases of IRIS. The authors concluded that patients with an acute OI (at least of PCP)\\nshould immediately start ART. \\nRegarding tuberculosis, at least five large randomized trials worldwide have discussed\\nthe optimal time to start ART (Abdool 2011, Blanc 2011, Havlir 2011, Török 2011,\\nWondwossen 2012). The general overview is as follows: Neither mortality nor AIDS-\\nrelated mortality are significantly improved by immediate initiation of therapy.\\nPatients showing below 50 CD4 T cells at diagnosis of tuberculosis seem to pose an\\nexception. It must always be considered that immediate initiation always implies\\nthe risk of a paradoxical worsening of tuberculosis associated with IRIS, reaching up\\nto 30% in some trials. Negative effects on survival have been observed in the case\\nof tuberculosis meningitis (Törok 2012). The same applies for cryptococcal  meningitis\\n(Makadzange 2010).  \\nIt is likely that differentiated recommendations depending on the OI must be given\\n(Lawn 2011). There is also some controversial debate, as to whether patients with\\nmalignant lymphomas and newly diagnosed HIV infections should receive ART\\nimmediately or after chemotherapy (see chapter on Lymphoma).\\n6.5.

Thus,\\nthis patient group is always underrepresented in evaluation of clinical efficacy data.\\nThe question if late presenters should be treated with a special antiretroviral therapy\\nis therefore not clear and depends more than with other patients on individual\\n decision-making (Manzardo 2007) (see above on “What to Start?”). Regarding\\nimmunologic success, no relevant difference was measured between NNRTI- and PI-\\nbased regimens with late presenters (Landay 2003, Samri 2007). New ARV classes are\\nalso considered for late presenters. In favor of raltegravir are its low interaction\\n potential, its overall tolerance and effectiveness in reducing viral load compared to\\nefavirenz, especially in the first weeks (Murray 2007). However, as described in\\nchapter 6.4, there is no evidence for a better immune reconstitution with drugs such\\nas raltegravir or maraviroc or T-20 (not indicated in Europe for first-line therapy). \\nReferences \\nAbdool Karim SS, Naidoo K, Grobler A, et al.

It’s about decades, not\\nmonths. All these details must be discussed before initiating therapy as ART needs\\nto become one more part of normal daily life.\\nAdherence\\nCompliance is defined as a patient’s consent and acceptance of therapy. In the mid-\\n90’s a new term, “adherence”, from the English, was adopted. Since then, the more\\npolitically correct term – “adherence” is frequently used. This term refers to both\\nphysician and patient working together to set up a treatment concept acceptable to\\nboth parties and emphasizes that responsibility for failure of the therapy is not auto-\\nmatically the patient’s fault.\\nAdherence includes all factors that influence staying on a regimen, in terms of accept-\\nability, under these three headlines:\\n1. The success of a treatment is endangered if medication is taken irregularly\\n2. Clinicians tend to overestimate a patient’s adherence \\n3. Adherence diminishes with the complexity of the treatment\\nIs the patient able to take the pills on his own? Did he understand that ART is a life-\\nlong treatment that should not be stopped when he feels better? Did he realize that\\nthere is no need to tolerate severe side effects? What is realistic, given his private\\nand social background?\\nNo doubt: adherence is the Achilles’ heel of every antiretroviral therapy. Non-adher-\\nence is the main, if not the major factor for developing resistance and treatment\\nfailure (Turner 2000). Partial viral suppression with insufficient drug levels is an ideal\\ncondition under which resistance grows. ART must be taken regularly, correctly or\\n178 ART'),\n",

Taking either more than 90% or less than 69% of the treatment are both\\nassociated with a lower risk of resistance (Sethi 2003).\\nNot only drug users, those dependent on alcohol or patients with side effects are\\nconsidered “risky patients” when it comes to adherence. In several studies, depressed\\npatients, patients living alone and younger patients have been identified as problem\\ngroups (Murri 2001, Glass 2006). Positive factors are the physician’s experience, the\\npatient’s confidence in the positive effects of ART, and social support. Race, sex or\\nstage of disease does not seem to be relevant. The individual’s general view of illness\\nand health, accepting modern medicine and fear of side effects are further consid-\\nerations. However, all these factors vary greatly, and in the end, adherence is diffi-\\ncult to predict in individual cases (Lerner 1998). The physician must rely on expe-\\nrience and intuition.\\nThe importance of taking drugs regularly has been demonstrated in numerous\\nstudies. In one study with 99 patients, in which compliance was evaluated via an\\nelectronic monitoring system, the rate of viral treatment failure was only 22% in\\npatients with a compliance level of at least 95% (95% of doses taken). Failure rates\\nof 61% and as much as 80% were measured with a patient’s adherence between \\n80–94% and <80% (Paterson 2000). \\nHowever, it must be taken into consideration that this much-cited study is outdated.\\nNewer drugs, such as darunavir, with longer half-lives, higher resistance barriers and\\nbetter overall pharmacokinetics may forgive a clearly higher non-compliance (Nelson\\n2010). In the previously mentioned study, clinicians misjudged their patient’s com-\\npliance in 41% of the cases. Nurses did better – judging incorrectly in only 30% of\\nthe cases (Paterson 2000). Adherence tends to be overestimated in other studies as\\nwell (Miller 2002).\\nThe importance of adherence was also demonstrated in patients with directly\\nobserved therapy (DOT) or directly administered ART (DAART), applied in some\\npenal institutions in the US. In institutions in Florida, 100% of the patients in a DOT\\nstudy achieved a viral load below 400 copies/ml after 48 weeks, compared to 81%\\nin an unmonitored control group (Fischl 2001). According to one randomized study,\\nresponse improved in drug-addicted patients receiving DAART (Maru 2009).\\nHowever, more recent data indicate that effects of DAART with PI based regimens\\nare marginal and disappear rapidly as soon as the patient is on his own (Gross 2009,\\nSmith-Rohrberg 2009, Berg 2011). Only transient effects were seen in studies evalu-\\nating DOT in HIV+ methadone patients or in African patients (Nachega 2010, Berg\\n2011, Nahvi 2012). The virologic benefit of these strategies wanes following transi-\\ntion to self-administered therapy.\\n6.6.

The 12-step table below provides additional sug-\\ngestions. In addition, a number of strategies on improving adherence have been\\ninvestigated.

These mutations should be considered when choos-\\ning an ART regimen as a single NNRTI mutation such as K103N could compromise\\na whole combination. Although TDRM can persist in the absence of drugs for con-\\nsiderable time periods, many of them disappear over time, mainly due to fitness-\\ncosts. For example, the reversion rates of key mutations such as M184V (which\\nreduces the replicative capacity of the virus) are very high. Thus, in untreated patients\\nit is recommended to perform resistance testing as soon as possible. \\nConcurrent illnesses\\nBefore starting treatment, concurrent illnesses should be identified (anamnesis,\\nexamination). This is fundamental in helping make the right choice (Table 6.2).\\nFor example, a patient with diarrhea should not be given fosamprenavir or lopinavir.\\nUse tenofovir or indinavir with caution in patients with renal disease. Atazanavir\\nmay also be associated with renal diseases (Mocroft 2010). ddI and d4T are con-\\ntraindicated in patients with a history of pancreatitis or polyneuropathy and are no\\nlonger recommended in first-line therapy. Non-insulin-dependent diabetes can\\nbecome insulin-dependent with PI treatment. Patients with osteoporosis or osteope-\\nnia should avoid tenofovir. If caution is needed with abacavir in individuals with an\\nincreased risk of myocardial infarction, as recommend by some experts (Behrens\\n2010), is not clear (see abacavir). \\nLiver disease and chronic hepatitis must also be taken into account, because the risk\\nof developing severe hepatotoxicity on nevirapine or ritonavir is high (Sulkowski\\n2000). Caution is also required with boosted PIs. However, one study conducted in\\nover 1000 patients found no difference between lopinavir/r and an unboosted PI\\nsuch as nelfinavir in patients coinfected with hepatitis C (Sulkowski 2004). \\nIn coinfections with HBV , 3TC, or even better, TDF+FTC should be utilized\\n(Avihingsanon 2010). Long-term monitoring of HBV over a span of five years or\\nlonger is useful with tenofovir (de Vries-Sluijs 2010). However, in HBV-coinfected\\npatients starting ART, two HBV drugs should be used in order to reduce the risk of\\nHBV resistance. Avoid Combivir\\n® or Kivexa® in cases of hepatitis B coinfection when\\nno other HBV agent is on board – 3TC alone is not enough for HBV. Last but not\\nleast, a wish for parenthood should be considered.

Whereas interactions\\nbetween antiretroviral drugs are well known, those with other medications are often\\nless well characterized (see section on interactions). The urgent need for more research\\nwas demonstrated in a study investigating the interactions between ART and lipid\\nlowering agents. In healthy volunteers, the measurement of plasma levels showed\\nthat levels of simvastatin were elevated by 3059% after concurrent dosing with riton-\\navir or saquinavir (Fichtenbaum 2002). Several cases of fatal rhabdomyolysis on sim-\\nvastatin, atorvastatin and PIs such as atazanavir or lopinavir have been described\\n(Review: Chauvin 2013). There are even case reports on pravastatin and rosuvastatin\\n(Mikhail 2009, de Kanter 2011), so boosted PIs or INIs such as elvitegravir/c should\\nbe utilized with caution. The same applies to several HCV drugs such as daclatasvir.\\nMany other drugs should be avoided in combination with particular antiretroviral\\ndrugs, as incalculable interactions may occur. These include certain contraceptives.\\nEven drugs that seem unproblematic at first glance can have unfavorable effects. For\\nexample, the plasma levels of saquinavir can be reduced by half with administration\\nof garlic capsules (Piscitelli 2002). One noteworthy interaction is between PIs and\\ninhaled or intranasal corticosteroids. This interaction can result in adrenal insuffi-\\nciency and iatrogenic Cushing’s syndrome (Saberi 2013). Even a seemingly harmless\\nagent such as vitamin C can influence plasma levels. A small study in healthy vol-\\nunteers showed that vitamin C can significantly lower (14%) unboosted indinavir\\nlevels (Slain 2005). Coumarin derivative anticoagulants, such as warfarin can also\\nbe a problem; ritonavir can significantly lower plasma levels (Llibre 2002). Further\\ntypical problem drugs include migraine remedies, prokinetic drugs and sedatives/\\nhypnotics. One fatal case was described with ergotamine and ritonavir (Pardo 2003).\\nThe simultaneous administration of ART and PDE-5 inhibitors (sildenafil, vardenafil,\\ntadalafil) can also be problematic.\\nDrugs or alcohol can interact with ART (Neuman 2006, Mass 2006). For those in sub-\\nstitution programs, the methadone requirement may be significantly increased by\\ncertain antiretroviral drugs, such as nevirapine and efavirenz (Clarke 2001). To a\\nlesser extent, this is also true for ritonavir and nelfinavir. There is inconsistent data\\non lopinavir but it may also require dose adjustments. Raltegravir, seems to have no\\neffects (Anderson 2010).\\nOther interactions have even more dangerous consequences. Several deaths have\\nbeen reported after simultaneous dosing with ritonavir and amphetamines or\\nMDMA/ecstasy, the popular narcotic gamma hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) or “liquid\\necstasy” (Henry 1998, Harrington 1999, Hales 2000). Ritonavir in particular inhibits\\nthe metabolism of amphetamines, ketamines or LSD (Antoniou 2002). Clinicians\\nand patients are well advised to have an open conversation about drug use before\\nstarting therapy. Marijuana and THC appear to have a low potential for interactions\\n(Kosel 2002). Amphetamines seem to be particularly dangerous and neurotoxic in\\nHIV+ patients (Chana 2006).\\nNot every agent can be discussed here. Many are described in the respective drug\\nchapters and in the Interactions chapter. It is always recommended to check the\\npackage insert. Initiation of ART provides a good opportunity to re-evaluate exist-\\ning prescribed medications.\\nAdditive toxicities\\nAlthough toxicity of newer antiviral agents has been markedly reduced, compared\\nto first generation compounds such as AZT, ddI or d4T, several potential additive\\ntoxicities should be considered in the choice of therapy.

However, if ART failed, resist-\\nance was less frequent and CD4 T cells increased more in the LPV/r arm. The ACTG\\n5142 trial showed that NNRTIs were possibly more effective than boosted PIs, because\\nthey were better tolerated. Resistance, however, occurs faster on NNRTIs than on PIs,\\nwhich is probably due to the low resistance barrier. This phenomenon was observed\\nin trials such as FIRST, ARTEN and ACTG 5202 (Gardner 2008, Daar 2011, Soriano\\n2011).\\nThese observations were confirmed in a systematic evaluation of 20 studies that\\nincluded 7,949 patients (see Table 6.5). All of the patients had been treated with\\neither an NNRTI or a boosted PI, and had additionally received 3TC or FTC. Virologic\\nfailure was as frequent on NNRTIs as on PIs (4.9% versus 5.3% of patients, p=0.50).\\nHowever, major differences were observed in patients with virologic failure whose\\ngenotypic resistance testing was successful. Mutations were significantly higher with\\nNNRTIs. This applied for NRTI key mutations like the M184V and K65R, and also\\nfor other resistance mutations.\\nTable 6.5: Rates of resistance mutations at therapy failure on first-line regimens containing NNRTIs\\nor PIs, in percentages (Gupta 2008)\\nNNRTIs PIs p\\nM184V 35.3 (29.3–41.6) 21.0 (14.4–28.8) <0.001\\nK65R 5.3 (2.4–9.9) 0 (0–3.6) 0.01\\nResistance to third agent (NNRTI or PI) 53.0 (46–60) 0.9 (0–6.2) <0.001\\nINSTIs versus NNRTIs or PIs\\nIn large, randomized trials such as STARTMRK, GS102 and SINGLE, the three inte-\\ngrase inhibitors raltegravir, elvitegravir/c and dolutegravir were tested against the\\nstandard therapy efavirenz (Rockstroh 2011, Wohl 2014, Walmsley 2013). All three\\nintegrase inhibitors were better tolerated. More patients discontinued efavirenz,\\nmainly due to CNS toxicity. In FLAMINGO, GS103 and ACTG 5257, the integrase\\ninhibitors were also tested against boosted PIs such as atazanavir/r or darunavir/r\\n(Clotet 2014, Clumeck 2014, Lennox 2014). Dolutegravir und raltegravir were\\n superior, mainly with regard to tolerability. \\nIt is important to consider, however, that tolerability depends on the specific setting\\nand context of each study. During recent years, a switch to another regimen has\\nbecome easier. The growing repertoire of antiviral agents implicates that the “toler-\\nance threshold” of both patients and their physicians declines. Especially the toler-\\nability of efavirenz has been reduced during recent years – in SINGLE, around 10%\\nof all patients discontinued efavirenz due to CNS toxicity. These high rates have not\\nbeen observed in older studies.  \\nSo what about resistance-associated virological failure in these studies, the most rel-\\nevant endpoint? Data suggest that resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) are less\\nfrequently seen with raltegravir and elvitegravir (1–2%) than with NNRTIs (1–9%).\\nCompared to boosted PIs, the rates are higher. In ACTG 5257 (ARDENT), a three-\\narmed trial, raltegravir was superior to both PIs, mainly due to better tolerability, but\\nthere were more RAMs (18/603 = 3%) seen with the integrase inhibitor (Lennox\\n2014). With dolutegravir, however, no RAMs were seen in all clinical trials, suggest-\\ning that the resistance barrier of this compound is as high as that of boosted PIs. In\\nthe FLAMINGO trial, not a single RAM was detected in any of the patients failing\\non dolutegravir or darunavir/r – a first in HIV therapy (Clotet 2014). \\n188 ART'),\n",

One should be warned against cross-trial com-\\nparisons, which are often used as marketing strategies to influence health providers\\non the effectiveness of a specific treatment (“we achieved over 90% tolerance rates\\nin our study”). In a systematic evaluation of 10 large-scale randomized trials with\\n2,341 therapy-naïve patients receiving AZT+3TC+efavirenz, the success rates (viral\\nload in the ITT analysis <50/copies/ml at 48 weeks) ranged between 37% and 77%.\\nThis broad range was seen with use of the same combination in ART-naïve patients!\\nThe rates of adverse events also differed considerably. Heterogeneous patient popu-\\nlations and study designs (definition of therapy failure), clinician experience and\\npatient adherence may lead to variations (Hoffmann 2007). \\nBelow, various strategies or primary therapies are discussed. These include:\\n\\x81 Two NRTIs plus an NNRTI\\n\\x81 Two NRTIs plus a PI\\n\\x81 Two NRTIs plus an integrase inhibitor (INI)\\n\\x81 Experimental combinations (nuke-sparing, intensive approaches) \\n\\x81 Three or four NRTIs (triple nuke, quadruple nuke)\\n\\x81 Problematic primary therapies to be avoided\\n1. Two NRTIs plus an NNRTI\\nNNRTIs have an equal if not superior effect on surrogate markers compared to PI\\ncombinations. In numerous randomized studies, efavirenz-based regimens were\\nsuperior to unboosted PIs such as indinavir or nelfinavir (Staszewski 1999, Robbins\\n2003) and at least equivalent to lopinavir/r (Riddler 2003) and atazanavir (Daar 2010).\\nWhen tested against INIs, efavirenz-based regimens were less successful, especially\\nwhen compared to dolutegravir (Rockstroh 2011, Walmsley 2013, Wohl 2014).\\nNevirapine-containing regimens were roughly equivalent to atazanavir/r or\\nlopinavir/r (McIntyre 2010, Soriano 2011). However, nevirapine-based (or rilpivirine-\\nbased) regimens were never tested against INIs. \\nAdvantages of NNRTI regimens include the low pill burden and good long-term tol-\\nerability. In contrast to PIs, however, data with clinical endpoints is not available.\\nNeither is there any long-term data or studies on severely immunocompromised\\npatients. A disadvantage of NNRTI combinations is the rapid development of cross-\\nresistance. This could result in failure, especially for highly viremic patients, although\\nthis has not been confirmed. Resistance upon virological failure is generally more\\nfrequent on NNRTIs than on PIs (Gupta 2008, see above). \\nAllergies are frequent on all NNRTIs. The incidence is highest with nevirapine, but\\nallergies are also seen with efavirenz, etravirine or rilpivirine. Hepatic adverse events\\nrequiring careful monitoring (nevirapine) but also central nervous system side effects\\nand potential teratogenicity (efavirenz) should be considered. The 2NN trial showed\\nno significant difference in efficacy between efavirenz and nevirapine in combina-\\ntion with d4T+3TC (van Leth 2004). Rilpivirine seems to be less potent in patients\\nwith high baseline viremia. \\nTDF+FTC plus efavirenzwas one of the most frequently used combination for many\\nyears. It is available as a single-tablet (STR), fixed-dose regimen Atripla\\n®. During recent\\nyears, Atripla® has been less frequently used as many patients complain about CNS\\nadverse events such as dizziness, sleep disorders and depression. With the growing\\nrepertoire of ART, patients are less willing to tolerate these well-known side effects.\\nAlthough the bioequivalence with each individual substance has been shown, the\\nEMA restricted the use of Atripla\\n®. It is only approved for patients with virological\\nsuppression under 50 copies/ml for at least three months on their current anti-\\n6.6. What to start with    189'),\n",

Furthermore, patients must not have experienced virological\\nfailure with an earlier treatment combination or be known to have resistance to any\\nof the three components in Atripla\\n®. There are also generics available for efavirenz.\\nIt remains to be seen how many patients will switch from Atripla ® back to generic\\ntriple-tablet regimens to obtain economic savings.\\nInstead of FTC one can also use 3TC. In the double-blind, randomized Gilead 903\\nStudy, this combination was effective and less toxic than d4T+3TC plus efavirenz\\n(Gallant 2004). However, the combination of TDF+3TC is seldom used today in Europe\\nand the US, as there is no FDC available. There is no reason to use 3TC instead of FTC.\\nTDF+FTC plus nevirapine is also still a frequently prescribed regimen. However,\\nthere is less data available than for efavirenz. Smaller trials observed an increased\\nrisk for therapy failure and for development of resistance, especially when viral load\\nwas high (Lapadula 2008, Rey 2009). The large ARTEN trial also showed a higher risk\\nfor resistance with TDF+FTC plus nevirapine, but an altogether comparable efficacy\\nto TDF-FTC plus atazanavir/r (Soriano 2011). In African woman with low CD4 T cells\\nthis regimen demonstrated equivalent antiretroviral efficacy but higher rates of treat-\\nment discontinuation and new drug resistance compared with lopinavir/r plus\\nTDF/FTC (Lockman 2012). In favor of nevirapine are its good lipid profile\\n(Podzamczer 2012) and the excellent long-term tolerability, despite some risk for\\nsevere allergies and hepatotoxicity in the first weeks. Since 2011, an extended-release\\ntablet of nevirapine is on the market which can be taken once-daily. The old 200\\nmg tablets (for BD use) are available as generics. \\nTDF+3TC plus rilpivirine is available as the FDC tablet Eviplera\\n® since November\\n2011. In a double-blind randomized trial (ECHO), this combination proved as effec-\\ntive as TDF+FTC and efavirenz, showing a slightly better tolerance regarding lipids\\nand CNS side effects (Molina 2011, Cohen 2011). In the STaR Study, Eviplera\\n® demon-\\nstrated non-inferior efficacy and improved tolerability compared to Atripla® – at 48\\nweeks, 2.5% versus 8.7% of patients had discontinued their ART due to adverse events\\n(Cohen 2014). In addition, the lipid profile seems to better (Tebas 2014). However,\\nresistance mutations and virological failure rates were higher, especially in highly\\nviremic patients. This is why approval is limited to therapy-naïve patients with viral\\nloads below 100,000 copies/ml. Eviplera\\n® must be taken with a fatty meal in order\\nto be absorbed properly. This may also be a drawback for some patients.\\nABC+3TC plus efavirenz is an alternative first-line therapy, if HLA testing to predict\\nhypersensitivity to abacavir is available. The combination ABC+3TC plus efavirenz\\nhas been evaluated with success in numerous large trials such as CNA30024 (DeJesus\\n2004), ZODIAC (Moyle 2005) and ABCDE (Podzamczer 2006). More recently, studies\\nsuch as ACTG 5202 and ASSERT showed slightly less efficacy than on comparable\\nregimens (Post 2010, Daat 2011). Tolerability is good – in ASSERT, less renal and bone\\nside effects and were observed than with TDF+FTC plus efavirenz (Post 2010,\\nStellbrink 2010). Data on ABC+3TC plus nevirapine or rilpivirine are so far limited. \\nAZT+3TC plus efavirenz or nevirapine were among the most frequently used reg-\\nimens for many years. They have been evaluated in numerous milestone trials (006,\\nCombine, ACTG 384, 5095, 934). Side effects have limited its use. In the 934 Study,\\nanemia and gastrointestinal problems significantly compromised the efficacy of\\nAZT+3TC compared to TDF+FTC (Arribas 2008). Side effects such as increased lipids\\nand lipoatrophy are significantly reduced by switching to TDF+FTC (Fischer 2010).\\nAnother disadvantage of these combinations including AZT is the fact that QD dosing\\nis not possible. These regimens can only be recommended if there are good reasons\\nnot to use tenofovir or abacavir. One argument for this combination is economy –\\nall agents are available as generics, making this a cost-saving option. \\n190 ART'),\n",

Given the high\\nresistance barrier and the robustness of these regimens, many experts still prefer to\\nuse boosted PIs today, particularly in advanced patients with high viral load. \\nDarunavir, atazanavir or lopinavir/r are the main agents.

The combination proved at least\\nas effective as TDF+FTC plus lopinavir/r in the ARTEMIS trial. With regard to toler-\\nance (diarrhea, lipid changes) it was even better (Ortiz 2008). The effects remain\\nstable out to 192 weeks (Orkin 2013). In a small study, the metabolic profile was\\ncomparable to atazanavir (Aberg 2013). The resistance barrier is very high and resist-\\nance mutations during first-line are rarely seen. Gastrointestinal symptoms may\\noccur in some patients. In FLAMINGO and ACTG 5257, these problems led to slightly\\ninferior results compared to the integrase inhibitors dolutegravir and raltegravir,\\nrespectively (Clotet 2014, Lennox 2014). An advantage of this combination is the\\nonce-daily dosing. Darunavir can also be boosted with cobicistat (Kakuda 2014).\\nRecently, the FDA and EMA have granted marketing approval to the fixed-dose\\n combination of darunavir and cobicistat (Prezcobix\\n® or Rezolsta®), reducing the pill\\nburden to two tablets with this regimen. \\nTDF+FTC plus atazanavir/r/c:In the CASTLE trial, atazanavir/r proved virologically\\nequal to lopinavir/r, but with better lipids and similar tolerance (Molina 2010).\\nAlthough a randomized study showed no difference between unboosted and boosted\\natazanavir (Malan 2008, Squires 2009), boosting with ritonavir is recommended. The\\nmain arguments in favour of this combination are the low number of pills and the\\ngood lipid profile (compared to lopinavir/r) which, however, does not differ from\\ndarunavir (Aberg 2013). The major disadvantage is hyperbilirubinemia, which often\\nmanifests as harmless but disturbing icterus.

Atazanavir can also be boosted with cobicistat. Recently,\\nthe FDA and EMA have granted marketing approval to the fixed-dose  combination\\nof atazanavir and cobicistat (Evotaz ®), reducing the pill burden to two tablets with\\nthis regimen. \\nTDF+FTC or ABC+3TC plus lopinavir/r have been categorized in many guidelines\\nas a preferred combination. However, after the results of CASTLE, ARTEMIS and ACTG\\n5142 (see above), lopinavir/r was down-graded in the US (by the DHSS) to an “alter-\\nnative” regimen. More data is available for TDF+FTC as a backbone for lopinavir/r,\\nalthough the HEAT study did not find significant differences compared to ABC+3TC\\n(Smith 2008). Since 2009 lopinavir/r has also been licensed for once-daily use, after\\nseveral studies showed similar efficacy and tolerability (Molina 2007, Gathe 2009).\\nHowever, there is some evidence that the potency of once-daily dosing is slightly\\nless than with BID (Ortiz 2008, Flexner 2010). Lopinavir/r lost its main disadvan-\\ntage of requiring cool storage compared to other boosted PIs with the introduction\\nof the Norvir\\n® tablets in 2010. The main problem with this regimen are the some-\\ntimes intense diarrhea, leading to high discontinuation rates. Recently, some studies\\non dual therapy with lopinavir/r plus 3TC have been published (see below Nuke-S\\nsparing). AbbVie is currently working on a coformulation.\\nABC+3TC (or TDF+FTC) plus fosamprenavir/r: In the KLEAN study, this combi-\\nnation proved almost equal to ABC+3TC plus lopinavir/r in regard to both efficacy\\nand tolerability. Better rates of diarrhea or cholesterol levels were, however, not\\nachieved (Eron 2006). In the ALERT study, fosamprenavir/r was as effective as\\natazanavir/r, both combined with a TDF+FTC backbone (Smith 2006). In Europe,\\nonce daily use of fosamprenavir/r has not been licensed, although using a low booster\\nof 100 mg ritonavir should be possible (Hicks 2009, Cohen 2010). There is no clear\\nargument for this combination. \\nTDF+FTC plus saquinavir/r: Saquinavir was the first PI which showed a survival\\nbenefit (Stellbrink 2000). In the relatively small GEMINI study saquinavir/r with a\\nTDF+FTC backbone proved to be non-inferior to lopinavir/r (Walmsley 2009). The\\neven smaller BASIC study showed that a once-daily dosing (1000/100) was compa-\\nrable to atazanavir/r with regard to lipid profiles (Vrouenraetes 2009). The main\\n disadvantage of saquinavir-based regimens is the twice-daily dosing, the high pill\\nburden and a QT prolongation (ECG monitoring required!), which is why the\\n combination is very rarely used today. Recently, however, generics of saquinavir have\\nbeen introduced to the market.\\n3. Two NRTIs plus one integrase inhibitor \\nRaltegravir was licensed as the first integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INI) for first-\\nline treatment in 2009. In the meantime, elvitegravir and dolutegravir were licensed\\nby the FDA and the EMA. Tolerance and efficacy are both excellent. Convincing\\nlong-term data covering a period of 3-5 years, especially regarding tolerability, are\\nlacking. However, there is no doubt that INI-based regimens will be of growing impor-\\ntance in first-line therapy during the next years.\\nTDF+FTC (TDF+3TC) plus raltegravir: in the large STARTMRK trial, raltegravir\\nproved at least as effective as efavirenz (Lennox 2010). Viral load decreased more\\nrapidly in the raltegravir arm and CD4 T cell counts increased. In addition, toler-\\nance was better and effects lasted over 196 weeks (Rockstroh 2011). It should be\\nnoted that data is available for raltegravir with TDF-based backbones while data for\\nABC+3TC or other backbones is still very limited. A pilot study with ABC+3TC plus\\nraltegravir, however, showed no negative effects (Young 2010). Unfortunately, once-\\ndaily dosing of raltegravir is not possible (Vispo 2010, Eron 2011). This is why MSD\\nis working hard on a new formulation, allowing QD use (2 600 mg tablets). A main\\n192 ART'),\n",

This may be used in patients with comedications,  especially\\nchemotherapies or tuberculostatics. \\nTDF+FTC plus elvitegravir/c:was approved as a single tablet regimen (STR, Stribild®)\\nin June 2013. Two large Phase III trials yielded excellent results: In 236-0102 and\\n0103, elvitegravir/c has shown at least comparable efficacy over 144 weeks with\\nefavirenzand atazanavir/r (Clumeck 2014, Wohl 2014). Tolerability was good, except\\nfor some more cases of nausea and diarrhea. However, the combination of tenofovir\\nand cobicistat may be problematic as both agents interact primarily with distinct\\nrenal transporters. Cobicistat inhibits renal tubular secretion of creatinine and\\nincreases serum creatinine levels, resulting in a decrease in estimated glomerular\\n filtration rate (GFR) without a true decline in GFR. Thus, it may be difficult to\\n distinguish between these effects and the “true” renal toxicity of tenofovir. There\\nexist detailed renal monitoring and dosing guidance (see also Drugs). \\nABC+3TC (or TDF+FTC) plus dolutegravir: since the approval of dolutegravir in\\nearly 2014, these combinations have become an important option in first-line\\ntherapy. In SPRING-2, non-inferiority to raltegravir was shown in a double-blinded\\ndesign (Raffi 2013). Encouraging data were also reported from FLAMINGO, when\\ndolutegravir was superior to once-daily darunavir/r, mainly due to better tolerabil-\\nity (Clotet 2014). This was also the case with Atripla\\n®, as shown in the SINGLE Study\\n(Walmsley 2014). Of note, in all of these trials, there has been no report of treat-\\nment-emergent resistance with dolutegravir to this date. ABC+3TC plus dolutegravir\\nare available as a single-tablet regimen, named Triumeq\\n®. As with all regimens con-\\ntaining abacavir, HLA-testing is mandatory prior to initiation. When combined with\\nTDF+FTC, slight increases of creatinine levels are seen, due to an inhibition of tubular\\nsecretion. Compared to other regimens, long-term data with this combination is\\n relatively limited. \\n4. Experimental combinations\\nAntiretroviral therapies need to be more effective and tolerable. However, the pipeline\\nof new ARVs is limited. New strategies are needed, including new combinations with\\nold (approved) agents. Two new approaches have attracted great interest over the\\nlast years: combinations without any NRTIs (nuke-sparing), and so-called induction\\ntherapies. Both approaches will be discussed below.\\nNRTI-sparing and dual therapies\\nAll classical ART regimens have to date included a backbone of two nucleoside or\\nnucleotide analogs. This is mainly historical: nucleoside analogs were the first drugs\\non the market, and by the time NNRTIs and PIs were under development, treatment\\nwith two nucleoside analogs was standard. With growing knowledge of the mito-\\nchondrial toxicity of nucleoside analogs, omission of NRTIs (“nuke sparing”) is\\nincreasingly being investigated, even for first-line therapy. A slightly modified strat-\\negy is followed by the so-called dual therapies in which only one NRTI is given\\ninstead of two. This is usually 3TC, for two reasons: as it is less toxic than others and\\nit is available as generics. \\nStudies evaluating NRTI-sparing in ART naïve patients are shown in Table 6.7. – most\\nof them were small pilot studies that were underpowered to show non-inferiority of\\nNRTI-sparing strategies compared to standard therapy. However, in 2014 two large\\nlandmark studies, namely MODERN and NEAT001, have been published. These trials\\ntested the combination of maraviroc or raltegravir with the boosted PI darunavir/r.\\nThey will be discussed in a more detail as well as other strategies such as the com-\\nbination of NNRTI plus PI.\\n6.6.

ACTG 5142 was the first large study providing convincing\\nevidence for the NRTI-sparing strategy (Riddler 2008, Haubrich 2011, see above).\\nThis study showed that a combination of lopinavir/r and efavirenz was not inferior\\nto two NRTIs with either lopinavir/r or efavirenz. This was also shown by a smaller\\nstudy (Harris 2009). In contrast, a randomized African trial found that different NRTI-\\nsparing regimens (different NNRTIs plus PIs) were inferior to standard ART regimens\\n(Duvivier 2008). It is still unclear whether side effects really improve with these reg-\\nimens. A substudy of HIVNAT 009 reported that lipoatrophy resolved, and that vis-\\nceral fat and subcutaneous limb fat increased (Boyd 2005). In CTN 177 NRTI-sparing\\nregimens had a favorable effect on lactate levels (Harris 2005). In ACTG 5142 rates\\nof lipoatrophy were lower in the NRTI-sparing arm (Haubrich 2009). However,\\nadverse events in total were not reduced and dyslipidemia was observed even more\\nfrequently (Riddler 2008). Poor response rates were observed with double PI thera-\\npies, which is why this NRTI-sparing approach will probably not be further investi-\\ngated (Landman 2009, Ulbricht 2011). In total, data on NNRTIs plus PI remains\\nlimited. These combinations should not be used outside clinical trials. \\nINSTI plus PI: Many studies are ongoing, especially with raltegravir, combined with\\nthe main PIs darunavir, lopinavir or atazanavir. Several trials with dolutegravir are\\nongoing. What does the current data say?\\nThe randomized PROGRESS study evaluating 206 ART-naïve patients showed a more\\nrapid and impressive reduction of viral load after 8 weeks with raltegravir and\\nlopinavir/r than with the classic combination of TDF+FTC plus lopinavir/r. After \\n48 weeks, the antiviral effect was comparable. The results remained stable out until\\n96 weeks (Reynes 2013). There was a statistically significantly lower mean reduction\\nin estimated GFR and less changes in bone mineral density with NRTI sparing.\\nIn NEAT 001, a randomized, open-label, non-inferiority trial in treatment-naive\\nadults in 15 European countries, 805 patients were treated with raltegravir BD plus\\ndarunavir/r or with TDF+FTC plus darunavir/r.

The authors concluded\\nthat NRTI-sparing with raltegravir and darunavir/r was non-inferior to standard treat-\\nment and represents a treatment option for patients with CD4 T cell counts higher\\nthan 200 cells/µl (Raffi 2014).\\nPIs should always be boosted when NRTI-sparing regimens are used. In the SPARTAN\\ntrial, 4/63 (6.3%) patients developed raltegravir resistance mutations on a combina-\\ntion of raltegravir and unboosted atazanavir (Kozal 2012). This trial was stopped pre-\\nmaturely. A striking observation in SPARTAN was the high rate of severe hyper-\\nbilirubinemia (grade 4), with 21% on atazanavir plus raltegravir, compared to no\\ncases in the TDF+FTC plus atazanavir/r. This combination can therefore not be rec-\\nommended now.\\nCCR5 antagonists plus PI/r: Promising but preliminary results were shown with\\nthe combinations of atazanavir/r, lopinavir/r or darunavir, together with low-dose\\nmaraviroc. Resistance mutations were not observed in this early pilot studies\\n(Calcagno 2013, Mills 2013, Taiwo 2013). However, MODERN, the first large study\\nevaluating maraviroc plus darunavir/r in 797 patients, led to disappointing results\\n(Stellbrink 2014). At 48 weeks, only 77% of the patients had achieved a viral load\\nbelow 50 copies/ml with NRTI-sparing, compared to 87% in the standard arm with\\nTDF+FTC plus darunavir/r. The vast majority of patients had low level viremia at the\\ntime of virological failure. Although non of them developed any resistance muta-\\ntions, the data safety monitoring board decided to stop the trial in October 2013.\\nSince thena, NRTI-sparing with maraviroc and boosted PIs cannot be recommended\\nin first-line (pretreated patients see below).\\nDual Therapy (NRTI sparing with only one NRTI): 3TC is generic and thus very\\nattractive for diverse combinations. The best data are available for lopinavir. In\\nGARDEL, the dual combination lopinavir/r+3TC (400/100+150 BID) was tested in\\n426 treatment naïve patients against lopinavir plus 2 NRTIs (Cahn 2014). At 48 weeks,\\n88% versus 84% of the patients had a viral load of less 50 copies/ml (patients with\\nhigh baseline viral load: 87 versus 79%). More patients in the standard arm had dis-\\ncontinued their therapy due to adverse events. Lopinavir/r+3TC seems to be an inter-\\nesting, less expensive option, especially in areas with limited ressources. It remains\\nto be seen how guidelines in industrialized countries will deal with the GARDEL\\nresults. \\nMonotherapy, alternating therapy\\nCan it get any easier? Several studies introduced a very avant-garde concept in the\\nsummer of 2003: monotherapy with boosted PIs. With respect to the high resistance\\nbarrier of boosted PIs, success was considerable (Gathe 2009). Lipoatrophy can be\\navoided (Kolta 2011). However, in many studies, low-level viremia was found to be\\nmore frequent on monotherapies. In the MONARK study, only 64% (compared to\\n75% on AZT+3TC+lopinavir/r) of patients on lopinavir/r achieved a viral load of less\\nthan 50 copies/ml at 48 weeks (Delfraissy 2008). At 96 weeks it was only 47% (Ghosn\\n2009). Darunavir/r also started to show weaker effects in a small pilot study (Patterson\\n2009). According to one overview, the overall efficacy of monotherapy is slightly\\nless effective to standard ART (Bierman 2009). This strategy is not recommended for\\ntreatment-naïve patients. In view of the constantly growing choice of well-tolerated\\ncombinations, it is difficult to find good arguments for monotherapy other than cost\\naspects.\\n6.6. What to start with    195'),\n",

Because of fear\\nof rapid development of resistance, some physicians give initial treatment with an\\ninduction of four or even five drugs, and then simplify to a triple combination once\\nthe viral load has dropped below the level of detection.\\nThis theoretical concept has not yet been validated, and is based on hypotheses or\\nsmaller proof-of-concept studies (Ramratnam 2004) in which it has been shown that\\nthe viral load falls faster under intensive combinations than under standard thera-\\npies with three active drugs. Approaches in which multiple individual drugs (usually\\nnucleoside analogs) are given have to be distinguished from approaches in which\\nthree instead of two classes of drugs are used.\\nMultiple individual drugs: Current data indicates that there is no benefit to using\\nthis strategy. Giving two PIs or two NNRTIs instead of one sometimes produces even\\nnegative results (Katzenstein 2000, van Leth 2004). There is also no evidence in favor\\nof giving three instead of two NRTIs (Staszewski 2003, Orkin 2004, Mallolas 2008,\\nHammer 2010). In ACTG 5095 with 765 patients, there was clearly no difference\\nbetween Combivir\\n® plus efavirenz and Trizivir ® plus efavirenz, not even when the\\nstarting viral load was higher, or with regard to resistance (Gulick 2005). \\nMore drug classes: The data on whether to use three or two drug classes is less clear.\\nLarge studies on this subject, such as ACTG 388 (Fischl 2003), ACTG 384 (Robbins\\n2003, Schafer 2003), INITIO (Yeni 2006) or FIRST (May Arthur 2006) were conducted\\nwith old combinations with nelfinavir as the main PI and ddI+d4T as the backbone.\\nTherefore, validity of these studies is limited. A more recent randomized study with\\nadditional doses of T-20 in late presenters showed some effect on the viral load after\\n24 weeks, but these results were not sustained through week 48 (Joly 2010). In two\\nrecent trials trial, a PI based regimen, intensified with raltegravir and maraviroc, ini-\\ntiated during early infection fails to significantly further impact virologic or immuno-\\nlogic responses beyond those achieved with standard PI-based ART (Markovitz 2013,\\nChéret 2015). \\nIn summary, it is questionable whether intensification of therapy leads to any\\nimprovement at all and produces anything more than toxicity and cost. The studies\\nabove indicate that supposed improved efficacy (not shown in many trials) is coun-\\nterbalanced by more side effects.

While this may not be\\nthe case with quadruple nukes, the increasing knowledge of the mitochondrial\\n toxicity of NRTIs makes pure nuke therapies less attractive.\\nAZT+3TC+ABC in a single tablet Trizivir\\n® (BID) is the classic triple nuke therapy.\\nSince ACTG 5095, Trizivir ® is no longer equivalent (Gulick 2004) and clearly less\\neffective than AZT+3TC plus efavirenz. This also applies for developing countries,\\nwhere Trizivir\\n® is still occasionally propagated (Munderi 2011).\\nAZT+3TC+TDF: We have some experience with this approach. Given the different\\nresistance pathways of AZT and TDF, the thymidine analog seems to be protective\\nagainst tenofovir-associated mutations (Mauss 2005, see chapter on resistance).\\nHowever, larger studies have not been conducted. \\nAZT+3TC+ABC+TDF: Some studies have reported good responses and low rates of\\nvirologic failure on this quadruple nuke therapy (Moyle 2006, Gulick 2007). However,\\nthese studies were not powered to demonstrate equivalence to other combination\\nregimens. In two randomized studies, discontinuation rates were high, due to adverse\\nevents (Mallolas 2008, Puls 2010). In the ALTAIR study, it proved less effective than\\nthe standard ART regimen (Puls 2010). The long-term toxicity and efficacy of these\\ncombinations is still unknown.\\nTDF+3TC+ABC+ddI should be avoided (Jemsek 2004, Gallant 2005, Khanlou 2005).\\nIn up to 49% of patients, early virologic treatment failure was seen, probably due to\\na low genetic resistance barrier (Landman 2005). This is also true for treatment-expe-\\nrienced patients who want to simplify their therapy (Hoogewerf 2003, Perez-Elias 2005).\\nConclusion: Pure NRTI combinations are not recommended for first-line therapy.\\nTriple nuke is poorer in comparison to regimens of at least two classes and the results\\nof some of the single-class combinations are truly not good. Data on quadruple nukes\\nis too limited. However, triple and quadruple nuke therapy remains under consid-\\neration for maintenance therapy (see Chapter 7).\\n6. Suboptimal first-line therapies \\nCombinations generally considered to be suboptimal include all forms of mono- and\\ndual therapy, especially two nucleoside analogs, but also one nucleoside analog plus\\none NNRTI (Montaner 1998). When using NRTIs, it is important to make sure that\\nthey are not competing for the same pocket. The thymidine analogs AZT and d4T\\nare even antagonistic (Pollard 2002). The same is true for FTC and 3TC. According\\nto a warning letter by the company BMS in March 2011, d4T should generally be\\navoided (not only in first-line). \\nFull dose ritonavir can be rejected as an active agent, as tolerability is very poor.\\nThere is no longer a reason to use ddI, indinavir or nelfinavir in a first-line regimen.\\nSome drugs, such as T-20, etravirine, and tipranavir are not licensed for use in primary\\ntherapy. Drugs such as ddC (HIVID\\n®), saquinavir-SGC (Fortovase®) and amprenavir\\n(Agenerase®) have been taken off the market. \\nNNRTI combinations act non-competitively at the same site, and furthermore all\\ncan cause a rash, making differential diagnosis difficult. Efavirenz levels seem to be\\nlowered considerably in combination with nevirapine (Veldkamp 2001). In the wake\\nof the 2NN study, it seems clear that the combination of efavirenz and nevirapine\\nshould be avoided. The study arm with this combination fared worse than the other\\narms, mainly due to toxicity (Van Leth 2004). \\nTDF in a triple-nuke combination should not be administered. Many studies have\\nreported poor response rates, particularly in combination with ABC+3TC (Hoogewerf\\n2003, Jemsek 2004, Khanlou 2005, Gallant 2005) (see Triple Nukes).\\n6.6.

BMS even issued a warning letter\\n concerning TDF+ddI. There are unfavorable interactions between both agents.\\nToxicity is high (Blanchard 2003, Martinez 2004) – the combination of TDF+ddI no\\nlonger has a place in antiretroviral therapy. The same is true for FTC+ddI (Campbell\\n2013).\\nStarting gradually: All drugs should be started simultaneously. Highly significant\\ndifferences were shown between patients who had received three drugs immediately\\ncompared to those patients who were started on only two drugs (Gulick 1998, Ait-\\nKhaled 2002). This is significant in the long-term. A large cohort study showed that\\nthe risk of virologic failure was doubled even years later if dual therapy had been\\nthe starting regimen, even for as little as a few weeks (Phillips 2002).

When to switch\\nCHRISTIAN HOFFMANN \\nAntiretroviral therapy has to be modified frequently, even though the rates of mod-\\nification and interruptions have declined in recent years. In EuroSIDA, among almost\\n1200 patients who began ART after 1999, at one year after initiation, only 70% of\\npatients remained on their original regimen. 24% had changed, and 6% were off all\\ntreatment (Mocroft 2005). In an evaluation of the Swiss Cohort, 42% of 1318 patients\\nbeginning ART between 2005 and 2008 had modified therapy after one year, 22%\\nof them due to side effects (Elzi 2010). In general, ART is switched for three main\\nreasons (interruptions will be discussed separately):\\n\\x81 Acute side effects\\n\\x81 Long-term toxicity (or concerns regarding them)\\n\\x81 Virologic treatment failure\\n6.7.1. Switching due to acute side effects\\nNot every acute side effect requires immediate modification. Mild nausea or  diarrhea\\nat the beginning can and should be tolerated. Gastrointestinal side effects that occur\\nduring the first weeks often improve spontaneously or can be treated symptomati-\\ncally. The same is true for some allergic reactions and for mild CNS disorders. Talking\\nwith the patient, suggestions on how to tolerate or palliate certain problems with\\nthe idea that these will not continue indefinitely will help. However, certain adverse\\ndrug events almost always require discontinuation (see box). \\nSide effects that almost always require discontinuation/change of ART \\n\\x81 Severe diarrhea, which persists despite loperamide even after several weeks\\n(usually with nelfinavir, lopinavir/r, fosamprenavir/r)\\n\\x81 Severe nausea, which persists despite metoclopramide, which requires continu-\\nous treatment or leads to significant weight loss (usually AZT, ddI)\\n\\x81 Persistent sleeping disorder (efavirenz)\\n\\x81 Polyneuropathy (d4T, ddI, possibly also 3TC), often resolves very slowly\\n\\x81 Severe anaemia (AZT)\\n\\x81 Severe, progressive muscular weakness (d4T, ddI)\\n\\x81 Pancreatitis (ddI, ddI+TDF, d4T+ddI, in rare cases lopinavir/r)\\n\\x81 Lactic acidosis (most often d4T+ddI, but also all other NRTIs)\\n\\x81 Severe allergies with involvement of mucous membranes, fever (typically aba-\\ncavir, all NNRTIs, more rarely fosamprenavir or darunavir)\\n\\x81 QT prolongation (saquinavir, but also other ARVs)\\n\\x81 Renal failure (tenofovir/STRs, indinavir), nephrolithiasis (indinavir)\\n\\x81 Hepatotoxicity with transaminases >5 x normal values (nevirapine, tipranavir)\\n\\x81 Jaundice (nevirapine, atazanavir, indinavir, tipranavir)\\n\\x81 Rhabdomyolysis (raltegravir)\\n\\x81 Severe repetitive onychitis (indinavir, possibly also 3TC)\\n\\x81 Depression, psychosis (efavirenz, possibly also AZT)\\n204 ART'),\n",

Switching due to concerns over long-term toxicity\\nIn the last few years, many clinicians have started to change virologically successful\\ncombinations out of concern for cumulative long-term toxicities, especially in cases\\nof lipodystrophy and dyslipidemia. The switch strategy is based on the assumption\\nthat not all antiretroviral agents have similar toxicities. The most important switch\\nstudies are discussed below.\\nPI replacement with other agents \\nPIs may cause side effects in the long-term. Among these are lipodystrophy with\\nabdominal fat accumulation and at the back of the neck, but also gastrointestinal\\nside effects and dyslipidemia. Many randomized studies replacing a successful PI-\\nbased regimen by other drugs have been performed during recent years (Table 7.1).\\nTaken together, these studies show that lipid levels are most likely to improve after\\nswitching to other agents, in particular rilpivirine, nevirapine and integrase\\ninhibitors, and to a lesser extent, if ever, efavirenz. Quality of life and treatment sat-\\nisfaction improved significantly in the switch arms of most studies, probably due to\\nthe reduced pill burden. In cases of lipodystrophy the effects are clearly poorer and\\nless-well characterized. \\nTable 7.1: Randomized studies on switching from PIs to other drugs \\nSource witch n Effect of switch on \\nVL control Lipids (L), Lipodystropy (LD)\\nPI → NNRTIs      \\nBarreiro 2000     NVP 138 Advantage L unchanged, LD better\\nRuiz 2001        NVP 106 n.s.

A higher failure rate was also seen in the\\nSWITCHMRK trials in patients switching to the integrase inhibitor raltegravir (Eron\\n2010). In these two large-scale Phase II studies, a total of 702 patients on a stable\\nand functioning lopinavir-containing regimen were randomized to change to ralte-\\ngravir or to continue with lopinavir. Lipids improved with the switch, but after 24\\nweeks a non-inferiority of raltegravir compared to lopinavir/r in efficacy was not\\nseen. In the ITT analysis, only 82% of patients on raltegravir compared to 88% on\\nthe continued PI maintained viral load below the limit of detection after 24 weeks.\\nThe viral load breakthrough applied especially for pre-treated patients with previous\\ntherapy failure. A smaller open-label randomized study in Spain did not make the\\nsame observations, however. Patients had been below detection for a longer period\\n(Martinez 2010). In STRATEGY-PI, a trial in which patients were randomized to the\\nINSTI elvitegravir/c or to remain on their PI regimen, no rebounds were seen.\\nHowever, in this study patients with complex pre-treatment were excluded, in order\\nto avoid sobering results like SWITCHMRK, (Arribas 2014).

In the 903\\nStudy, lipids improved in patients that were switched from d4T to tenofovir. There\\nwas also an increase of the mean limb fat after three years (Madruga 2007). Several studies,\\nsome of them randomized trials, point in the same direction. Lipids,  lipo atrophy,\\nmitochondrial toxicity and patient satisfaction improve on tenofovir (Milinkovic\\n2007, DeJesus 2008, Ribera 2008, Fischer 2010, McComsey 2012, Martinez 2012).\\nRecently, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study showed unexpected\\nresults. In ACTG A5206, the addition of tenofovir alone to existing virologically-sup-\\npressed ART regimens improved lipid parameters compared to placebo (Tungsiripat\\n2010). However, the mechanism of the lipid-lowering effect warrants further study.\\nIn a retrospective study, replacing d4T with tenofovir improved both lipids and liver\\nenzymes (Schewe 2006). There is also one trial showing that switching from ABC+3TC\\nto FTC+TDF in persons with hypercholesterolemia on efavirenz maintains virologi-\\ncal control and significantly improves key lipid parameters (Moyle 2015).\\nIt must be noted that also negative effects may arise when switching to tenofovir.\\nRandomized studies in treatment-naïve patients have observed a stronger reduction\\nof bone density on tenofovir, compared to other NRTIs (Martin 2009, Stellbrink\\n2010). This negative effect is also seen in pretreated patients and there are also studies\\nshowing significant decreases in bone density after a switch to tenofovir (McComsey\\n2011, Haskelberg 2012, Rasmussen 2012). Bone turnover markers do improve when\\ntenofovir is replaced by raltegravir or abacavir (Bloch 2012, Negredo 2015). The\\npotential nephrotoxicity of tenofovir is another point. \\nSwitching to tenofovir-containing triple-nuke combinations must be avoided in\\ngeneral, as several studies have shown a high risk for an increase in viral load when\\nswitching to this combination (Hoogewerf 2003, Perez-Elias 2005), even after many\\nyears on successful ART. The resistance barrier is too low, as the patients example\\nabove shows. \\nIn practice, changes are often made that go further than PI and d4T/AZT, such as\\nreplacement of ddI, simply due to concerns over long-term toxicity. Such switching\\nis based on laboratory studies showing a certain hierarchy with respect to mito-\\nchondrial toxicity.\\nA lot of attention is being drawn to simplification of therapy, in which mono- or\\nnuke-sparing strategies are being used (see below). So far, there is no clear clinical\\nevidence to show that this procedure has any benefit for the patient. If the patient\\nhas no complaints, a switch to monotherapy or NRTI-sparing can not be justified\\nand subjects the patient to unnecessary risks.

This argues for this approach also in pre-\\ntreated patients.

The combination of NNRTI plus ralte-\\ngravir plus maraviroc has been mainly tested in salvage settings.

Data is too\\nlimited to draw definite conclusions.\\n6.7.3. Switching due to virologic failure\\nAny change in treatment due to virologic failure requires experience, a certain degree\\nof finesse and decisiveness. There are many possibilities for mistakes here. On the\\none hand, there is a threat of acquiring more resistance (if they have not already\\ndeveloped), but on the other hand, young physicians often want to quickly change\\ntreatment, which is not always necessarily the right solution. In many cases a fre-\\nquent change of therapy confuses the patient and causes anxiety. If the problem is\\nadherence, switching the regimen without talking about adherence may not be the\\nsolution. A switch only brings up more misunderstandings and, consequently, may\\ngenerate later resistance. It is always important to explain to patients, who often\\ntend to be skeptical (“should I save the other drugs for later?”) when and why treat-\\nment changes must be made.\\nAs a rule of thumb, ART should be changed quickly with insufficient viral suppres-\\nsion and/or a rise in plasma viremia, as otherwise future options could be limited.\\nOne speaks of insufficient viral suppression or virologic failure if the viral load is\\nrepeatedly above the level of detection. A switch is not recommended with tempo-\\nrary viremia (blips – more on this topic in the chapter Principles of Therapy). \\nEven single point mutations can be a problem. Tenofovir, abacavir, 3TC, FTC and\\nddI lose their efficacy in the presence of the K65R mutation, which is often selected\\nby tenofovir-containing triple-nuke therapies. Viral replication with insufficient\\nplasma levels is the best breeding ground for resistance. Therefore, it is recommended\\nto act fast if a clear virologic failure occurs. The longer one waits, the more compli-\\ncated it becomes. An insufficient viral suppression means, as stated before, a repeated\\nviral load above 50 copies/ml. Some clinicians tolerate levels of up to 500 or even\\n1000 copies/ml for months. We believe such hesitation is not justified in most cases\\nwhen patients have good options and good adherence. A patient’s frequent asser-\\ntions of not having symptoms should not count too much, either. Obviously, such\\nthoughts do not always play a role in clinical reality. In an analysis in Great Britain\\n34% out of 694 patients remained on a virologically unsuccessful combination for\\nover 6 months. Factors associated with an early switch were low CD4 T cells, a high\\nviral load and older age (Lee 2008).\\nTo date, only a few randomized trials have investigated strategies in patients in whom\\nseveral ART combinations have failed: either the patients change immediately or when\\nthe viral load reaches a certain level (early versus deferred switch). The preliminary\\nresults of some small randomized studies indicate that even in such cases one can\\nwait a short time (Nasta 2006, Tenorio 2009). However, these trials were small. It\\nseems difficult to recruit physicians and patients to participate in such strategy trials. \\n210 ART'),\n",

A frequent\\ncause may be a blip (see section on Goals and Principles of ART). These transient\\nand, almost always, small increases in viral load usually have no relevance. However,\\na measurable viral load may be due to treatment failure. It may indicate insufficient\\nplasma drug levels (measure these if possible). This may be due to drug malabsorp-\\ntion, drug interactions or simply insufficient dosing (e.g., in larger, heavy patients). \\nHow is the patient’s adherence? Adherence is critical. Any difficulties related to\\nthe regimen should be openly addressed. Is it the number of pills? Do restrictions\\nin food intake cause problems? Would once-daily treatment be better? Are there\\nother reasons, such as depression? Any misunderstanding on how to take the drugs?\\nThe risks of resistance development as a result of non-compliance should be reiter-\\nated. If plasma levels are sufficient and viral load remains detectable (monitor blips at\\nshort intervals – within a few weeks), treatment should be changed as soon as possible.\\nHow vulnerable is the present combination? NNRTI regimens are extremely sen-\\nsitive, and cross-resistance can develop particularly rapidly for the whole class. A\\nprompt change in therapy is more vital than with the other drug classes.

One should not wait too long.\\nWhat options does the patient have, and what are the consequences of the\\nchange in therapy? The more options that remain available the sooner they should\\nbe utilized. Therapy can sometimes be intensified quite easily (e.g., adding abacavir\\nplus an NNRTI).

How to switch ART\\nCHRISTIAN HOFFMANN\\nChanging a regimen that is successful but intolerable due to side effects is usually\\neasy. The suspected drug is replaced with another drug of the same class. It becomes\\nmore difficult if alternate drugs are contraindicated because of potential toxicity or\\nif resistance mutations to these drugs are suspected. In such cases, changes need to\\nbe individualized. This is particularly true in subjects with a treatment history of 15\\nyears or longer, who probably harbor multi-resistant viruses. Even physicians with\\nlots of experience in treatment should discuss these complex individual cases with\\ntheir colleagues. In many large centers, so-called weekly ART meetings have been\\nestablished. At these meetings, both virologists (to translate resistance testing) and\\nclinicians (with personal experience of the individual patient’s situation) can discuss\\nthese complex cases. This chapter discusses two important reasons for switching\\nwhere certain principles should apply: changing due to virologic failure, and chang-\\ning to simplify the regimen. Switching due to possible side effects has been discussed\\nin previous chapters.\\n6.8.1. Switching due to virologic failure\\nThe same principles apply as when initiating therapy: compliance, dosing issues,\\nconcurrent diseases, co-medications and drug interactions. It is also essential to con-\\nsider treatment history and possible existing resistance mutations. Although desir-\\nable before any change in treatment, resistance tests in cases of virologic failure are\\nnot always practical. It is therefore useful to become familiar with the most impor-\\ntant resistance mutations, particularly for nucleoside analogs: \\nTable 8.1: Expected resistance mutations with different nuke backbones \\nFailing nuke backbone Mutations\\nAZT/d4T+3TC M184V and then successive TAMs, the more one waits\\nAZT+3TC+ABC\\nTDF+3TC/FTC K65R and/or M184V\\nABC+3TC L74V, less frequently  K65R and/or M184V\\nAZT/d4T+ddI TAMs, Q151M, T69ins\\nTDF+ABC/ddI K65R\\nTable 8.2: Changing first-line therapy without knowledge of resistance mutations*\\nFailing initial therapy Potentially successful change\\n2 NRTIs + NNRTI Replace NNRTI by a boosted PI (rapid switch) or \\n1–2 new/active NRTIs plus boosted PI or \\nboosted PI plus RAL \\n2 NRTIs + 1 PI/r 1–2 new/active NRTIs plus INSTI (preferably DTG)\\n2 NRTIs + 1 INSTI 1–2 new/active NRTIs plus boosted PI (rapid switch) \\n* In individual cases, other modifications or simply waiting may be advisable.

Resistance patterns become more complex the longer\\none waits (Wallis 2010). In addition, the more drugs that are changed, the higher\\nthe likelihood of success for the new regimen. \\nTable 8.2 provides a rough guide on how to proceed without knowing the specific\\nresistance mutations. Of note, in individual cases, other modifications or simply\\nwaiting may be advisable. For complex cases, see also the following chapter on Salvage\\nTherapy.\\nVirological failure with NNRT-based regimens \\nThere is usually complete cross-resistance with efavirenz and nevirapine. Resistance\\ndevelops quickly. This applies also for rilpivirine which is vulnerable especially in\\nhighly viremic patients. Continuation in the presence of these resistance mutations\\nis of no use as they have no impact on the replicative fitness of the virus. Moreover,\\naccumulation of further resistance mutations may compromise the efficacy of second\\ngeneration NNRTIs such as etravirine. Therefore, NNRTIs should be discontinued if\\nresistance occurs or quickly be replaced by etravirine if the situation allows (etravirine\\nis only approved for use in combination with boosted PIs). Reduction of etravirine\\nactivity seems to take longer in patients experiencing therapy failure on nevirapine\\nvs. efavirenz (Cozzi-Lepri 2011). In patients with an isolated K103N mutation,\\nrilpivirine remains effective as shown by a small case series (Rokx 2014). In patients\\nwith long pretreatment with NRTIs and NNRTIs, however, a boosted PI should be\\nused in the case of virological failure. This boosted PI can also be combined with an\\nINSTI such as raltegravir, without continuing NRTIs. In SECOND-LINE (2013), an\\nopen-label non-inferiority trial at 37 sites worldwide, 558 patients with a failing\\nNNRT-regimen, were randomized to receive lopinavir/r plus either two or three NRTIs\\n(control group) or raltegravir. The NRTI sparing raltegravir regimen was no less effi-\\ncacious than the standard of care and was safe and well tolerated. Both strategies\\nmaintained efficacy greater than 75% and results were sustained until 96 weeks (Amin\\n2015). \\nThe largest study on patients with NNRTI failure was performed in Sub-Saharan Africa\\n(Paton 2014). In this open-label, three-arm trial, 1,277 patients were randomized to\\nreceive a) lopinavir/r plus clinician-selected NRTIs b) a PI plus  raltegravir or c) PI\\nmonotherapy after 12 weeks of raltegravir induction. The primary end point (chosen\\ndue to the resource-limited setting) was “good HIV disease control”, defined as\\n survival with no new AIDS events, a CD4 T cell count of more than 250 cells/µl and\\na viral load of less than 10,000 copies/ml. Good HIV disease control was achieved\\nin 60%, 64% and 55% of the patients. NRTIs retained substantial virologic activity\\nwithout evidence of increased toxicity, and there was no advantage to replacing them\\nwith raltegravir. Virologic control was inferior with PI monotherapy. Although these\\nresults may not fully transferable to industrial countries, they show that NRTI-sparing\\ncan be an alternative and that monotherapy in patients with virological failure is\\nnot a good idea. PI-monotherapies which can be an option as a maintenance strat-\\negy in patients with virological suppression (see below) have shown sobering results\\nin another study (Bunupuradah 2013). \\nVirological failure with PI-based regimens\\nThere are also relevant cross-resistance mutations for PIs. In the case of virological\\nfailure with first-generation PIs such as saquinavir or indinavir, these agents can be\\nreplaced by lopinavir/r or darunavir/r. If these PIs fail, an INSTI regimen is  necessary.\\nFor switching and sequencing PIs refer also to the salvage section of the next chapter.\\n214 ART'),\n",

One study showed that if M184V is detected\\nalone, cytidine analogs 3TC or FTC can be continued, provided a boosted PI is ini-\\ntiated. The effect of the boosted PI is enough to achieve virological success – 3TC\\nseems to be able to conserve M184V that in turn lowers viral fitness (Hull 2009). If\\nenough new agents are active, it may be reasonable to omit NRTIs in treatment-expe-\\nrienced patients failing a PI regimen, as shown by the ACTG OPTIONS Study (Tashima\\n2013). \\nIn patients with a truly failing PI-regimen (repeated viremias above 200 copies/ml,\\ndetection of PI resistance mutations), a new INSTI regimen is recommended. A new\\nNNRTI alone is often not sufficient (Abgrall 2007, Khaykin 2008). The two INSTIs\\nraltegravir and elvitegravir/c were of similar potency in patients with virological\\nfailure (most patients were on PI-based regimens). In 145, a double-blinded ran-\\ndomized study, patients were randomized to elvitegravir QD or raltegravir BID with\\na fully active boosted PI plus a third agent. The proportion of subjects maintained\\nHIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL through week 96 were 48% and 45% (Elion 2013).\\nDolutegravir seems to be even more potent, as shown by the large SAILING trial, a\\ndouble-blinded non-inferiority study in 715 patients with virological failure and\\nresistance to two or more classes of antiretroviral drugs. Patients received dolute-\\ngravir 50 mg QD or raltegravir 400 mg BID, with investigator-selected background\\ntherapy. At week 48, 71% patients on dolutegravir had HIV-RNA less than \\n50 copies/ml, versus 64% patients on raltegravir. Superiority of dolutegravir versus\\nraltegravir was concluded. Of note, significantly fewer patients had virological failure\\nwith INSTI RAMs on dolutegravir (treatment-emergent integrase-inhibitor resistance\\non dolutegravir (four vs 17 patients). Dolutegravir seems to have the highest poten-\\ntial in pre-treated patients with PI-failing regimens (see next chapter). \\nVirological failure with INSTI-based regimens\\nFailure of an INSTI-based regimen in first-line is a rare event. With elvitegravir or\\nraltegravir, the risk seems to be around 1–2%. If these regimens fail, a rapid switch\\nis recommended, in order to preserve the efficacy of dolutegravir. Dolutegravir\\nremains effective in patients with limited INSTI RAMs (see Salvage Chapter). In \\nthe case of concomitant NRTI resistance mutations, a boosted PI should be consid-\\nered. \\n6.8.2. Simplification – do maintenance therapies work?\\nCan HIV infection be treated in a similar fashion to mycobacterias, with a sequence\\nof intense induction therapy followed by less toxic (and less expensive) maintenance\\ntherapy? The idea is appealing, and has circulated almost since the existence of com-\\nbination ART. Between 1998 and 2003, the answer was clearly that maintenance\\ntherapies do not work. Three randomized studies (Trilège, ADAM, ACTG 343)\\ndestroyed any hope that ART might be reduced to two or even one drug. By today’s\\nstandards, one could object that outdated agents such as saquinavir, indinavir or\\nnelfinavir were used (Havlir 1998, Reijers 1998, Flander 2002).\\nIn the last few years better drugs have been licensed. In particular, lopinavir and\\ndarunavir with high resistance barriers cast a different light on the negative image\\nof maintenance therapies. Randomized studies already exist for lopinavir/r and\\ndarunavir/r, but other boosted PIs such as atazanavir/r have also been investigated\\nas PI/r monotherapy (see Table 8.3).\\n6.8.

In the OK04 study with lopinavir/r, even a reduc-\\ntion of lipoatrophy rates was achieved. The observation period was extended to four\\nyears (Cameron 2007, Pulido 2008). However, other studies failed to show any effect\\non lipoatrophy (Bernadino 2013). In MONARK, bone density improved after a switch\\nto darunavir/r monotherapy (Guarladi 2014). \\nHowever, some patients on lopinavir/r show low levels of viremia, especially in\\n combination with low CD4 T cells. They tend to show poor compliance (Campo\\n2007, Pulido 2008, Gutmann 2010). The same was observed with therapy-naïve\\npatients (see above). \\nFor darunavir, the results of two large randomized studies MONET and MONOI with\\nidentical design are published (Clumeck 2011, Valentin 2012). In MONET, non-infe-\\nriority of the monotherapy could not completely be shown after 96 weeks, at least\\nregarding the primary endpoints (Clumeck 2011). In total, 82% of patients were\\nbelow 50 copies/ml in the standard arm at week 96, compared to 78% on darunavir\\nmonotherapy. At week 144, the difference was 6% (Arribas 2012). When virologi-\\ncally successful therapies were not evaluated as failure, a difference was not observed.\\nThe results can be explained by a possibly low adherence in the mono-arm (with\\nsignificantly more HCV-coinfected patients). \\nIn MONOI, transient viremia was more frequent on monotherapy and a permanent\\ncontrol under 50 copies/ml without blips was observed in 59% versus 70% of patients\\nat week 96 (Valantin 2012).

For indinavir/r, saquinavir/r and fosamprenavir/r there are\\none-arm pilot studies with weak results (Kahlert 2004, Patricia 2010, Saumoy 2011).\\nThe Ataritmo study observed an elevated viral load in cerebrospinal fluid within\\nsome patients on atazanavir with otherwise well suppressed viral loads. In the OREY\\nstudy, 9/63 patients developed virological failure (Pulido 2009). \\nIn a systematic review of 10 randomized trials of 1,964 patients with HIV RNA\\n suppression at baseline, PI monotherapy showed a higher risk of HIV RNA eleva-\\ntions, and small numbers with HIV RNA detectable in CSF and concomitantly in the\\nplasma. However, there was no increased risk of treatment-emergent drug resistance\\n(Arribas 2014). The risk of treatment emergent NRTI or PI resistance was 11/973\\n(1.1%) for patients on PI monotherapy, versus 7/991 (0.7%) for patients on triple\\ntherapy. HIV-1 RNA suppression rates after intensification were similar between PI\\nmonotherapy and triple therapy.\\nMore recently, new approaches such as dual therapies (ususally with 3TC as a single\\nNRTI) have been evaluated. In studies like SALT and OLE, atazanavir/r or lopinavir/r\\nhave been combined with 3TC (see above), the results are encouraging. In contrast,\\ndual therapy with an NNRTI is not recommended. In the COOL study, many patients\\ndeveloped virological failure on TDF plus efavirenz (Girard 2006).\\nConclusion: Monotherapies with boosted PIs such as lopinavir/r and darunavir/r are\\nslightly less effective than classic therapies (review: Mathis 2011). In most cases, low-\\nlevel viremia without resistance appears that does disappear upon intensification\\n(Arribas 2014). Risk factors for monotherapy failure are poor adherence, a prior viro-\\nlogical failure and a low CD4 T cell nadir. Monotherapies as a strategy can not be\\njustified at this time. In individual cases, however, they may be able to reduce adverse\\nevents. Dual therapy of a boosted PI and 3TC are promising, coformulations are in\\ndevelopment. These combinations may have the potential to reduce some of the\\nlong-term toxic effects associated with NRTIs, preserve future treatment options, and\\nreduce the cost of antiretroviral therapy.\\nSwitching to simplify – triple-nukes revisited\\nTriple nuke therapy, fairly obsolete for first-line therapy, may be justifiable in\\n maintenance therapy. Several randomized studies have not detected any virologic\\ndisadvantage (Katlama 2003, Markowitz 2005, Sprenger 2010). \\nIn the ESS40013 study, a total of 448 patients were treated with AZT+3TC+ABC plus\\nefavirenz. After 36 or 44 weeks, 282 patients with undetectable viral load were ran-\\ndomized to continue with the same therapy or to stop efavirenz. After 96 weeks,\\n79% versus 77% of patients were still below 50 copies/ml, proving that triple nuke\\nwas not inferior (Markowitz 2005). Similar results were also seen in the TRIZAL and\\nFREE study, in which 209 patients were randomized (Katlama 2003, Sprenger 2010).\\nIn the Swiss Cohort, the failure rate was low in 495 patients with suppressed viral\\nload and switch to Trizivir\\n®. Patients with earlier exposure to mono- or dual-NRTI\\ntherapy, low CD4 T cell count at time of switch, or AIDS were at increased risk of\\ntreatment failure, limiting the use of Trizivir\\n® in these patient groups (Wolbers 2007).\\nSome long-term data for the quadruple-nuke strategy with Trizivir ® plus tenofovir\\n(d’Ettore 2007, Llibre 2008) also exist.\\nTaken together, maintenance therapy using Trizivir\\n® seems feasible. However, the\\nbenefit remains questionable. Three or four NRTIs are possibly more toxic than other\\nstrategies. Strategies such as monotherapy with boosted PIs are not yet justifiable\\noutside clinical trials. \\n6.8. How to switch ART    217'),\n",

Salvage therapy\\nCHRISTIAN HOFFMANN\\nBackground\\nThe term “salvage therapy” is not clearly defined in HIV medicine. As in oncology\\nthe term is currently used to refer to varying situations. Some speak of salvage only\\nif all drug classes have failed, whereas others employ the term from second-line\\ntherapy onward. Today, many clinicians talk about salvage when there is resistance\\nto at least two or three antiretroviral drug classes. \\nTriple class resistance (TCR) is present when viral resistance-associated mutations\\n(RAMs) against the three conventional drug classes NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIs have\\ndeveloped. Triple class failure (TCF) means that the viral load remains detectable\\nalthough these three drug classes have been used. Analogous to MDR tuberculosis,\\ntriple class resistant viruses with additional resistance mutations are also referred to\\nas multi-drug resistant (MDR) viruses. However, these terms are not uniformly\\ndefined.\\nSignificant progress has been made for patients with TCR and/or MDR viruses over\\nthe last few years. Several agents are now available, showing remarkable effects in\\npatients with multiple RAMs. Even in intensely pretreated patients all efforts should\\nbe made to get viral loads to below the limit of detection (Youle 2006). \\nThe number of patients with TCF is in decline and not, as often presumed, increas-\\ning (Lohse 2005+2006). Today, TCF or TCR are mainly observed in patients who were\\ntreated with mono- or dual therapy in the 90s (Napravnik 2007). In an analysis of\\nalmost 92,000 patients in Europe, the TCF rate was only 3.0% during the years 2000–\\n2009. Since 2005, the rate of patients who do not achieve a viral load of less than\\n50 copies/ml due to TCF has plateaued at low prevalence (Plato 2012). New cases of\\nTCF are rare. The rate of patients without any options is very low and usually less\\nthan 1% (De Luca 2013).\\nGiven that this patient group is small, it is difficult to do studies with sufficient\\npower. Homogenous populations do not really exist and every patient has his own\\nindividual therapy history and resistance pattern. In larger centers as many as 50\\ndifferent combinations are used. This makes it difficult to test new salvage agents in\\nPhase II/III studies. The design of these studies is another problem: as the single use\\nof an experimental drug within a failing regimen is ethically questionable, ART must\\nalways be optimized (OBT, optimized background therapy). If the OBT is too good,\\nthe effect of the new drug may be hidden, as many patients achieve a good viral\\nsuppression just on OBT. If the OBT is poor, the effect of the new drug may only be\\ntemporary or too weak – the window through which the efficacy of a new salvage\\ndrug can be seen is small. The failure of the CCR5 antagonist vicriviroc (Gathe 2010)\\nis only one of many examples. This shows how difficult it has become to bring a\\nnew drug to market.\\nPreface\\nFirst a few words about daily practice: it should not be forgotten that patients with\\nTCF, who often have a long history of being on treatment and who now find them-\\nselves once again on the precipice, need encouragement. It is important not to leave\\nthese patients without hope. It usually takes years to progress from virologic treat-\\nment failure to immunologic and finally clinical failure (see Principles of Therapy).\\nFortunately these patients – most having been treated for fifteen years or longer,\\n6.9.

The switch in 2007 was deferred until DRV and\\nRAL were available in order to use both agents simultaneously. T-20 was recycled when resistance\\ntesting did not clearly show if darunavir was still active. Although not foreseeable how long this therapy\\nsuccess will last, the complete and durable suppression of the patient’s viral load is remarkable after\\nso many years. A pill reduction was done in 2014 (now 4 pills/day). Further deescalation of the current\\ntreatment seems risky at present\\nPatients with TCF probably have a worse prognosis than patients without TCF (Lohse\\n2007). In a population-based study from the Danish HIV Cohort on all patients who\\nexperienced TCF between 1995 and 2004 (n=179), the total number of genotypic\\nresistance mutations and specific single mutations predicted mortality. In a regres-\\nsion model adjusted for CD4 T cell count, HIV RNA, year of TCF, age, gender and\\nprevious ART regimen, harboring at least 9 (versus less) mutations was associated\\nwith increased mortality (Lohse 2007). However, things have changed. There are new\\noptions for patients with TCF. \\nMoreover, other studies did not find an association between number of resistance\\nmutations and mortality (Lucas 2004). With good CD4 T cell counts, even despite\\nTCR viruses, the risk of developing AIDS is relatively small (Ledergerber 2004). TCR\\nviruses have less ability to replicate and are probably less aggressive (Prado 2005).\\nMoreover, further progress has to be expected. New drug classes such as attachment\\nor maturation inhibitors but also neutralizing antibodies will represent new options.\\nSo, in cases of TCR or MDR, be patient. \\nIt is, however, important that patients with MDR viruses are very carefully moni-\\ntored and undergo regular (monthly) full-body exams – something that is often neg-\\n224 ART'),\n",

However, in many of these trials, patients were not\\nas heavily pretreated as in the above mentioned trials such as TORO, MOTIVATE or\\nBENCHMRK (Table 9.2). In the 145-Study, in which raltegravir and elvitegravir were\\ntested in a double-blinded design (with similar results), the main inclusion criteria\\nwere a viral load of more than 1.000 copies/ml on ART for at least 30 days, docu-\\nmented resistance or at least 6 months of ART (Elion 2014). In the SAILING Study,\\nin which superiority of dolutegravir over raltegravir was shown, patients were\\nenrolled when they had at least 400 copies/ml and RAMs against only two classes.\\nAt least one fully active agent was required (Cahn 2014). \\nHowever, studies like SAILING, although not conducted in “true” salvage patients,\\nprovide practical information for the concrete treatment of these patients (see below). \\nWhat to do in patients with TCR\\nFirst of all, a resistance test should be available that was not done during a treatment\\ninterruption. Older resistance tests should also be reviewed. Resistance mutations\\ndetected earlier presumably still exist even if they are no longer detected. It is also\\nimportant to check incompatibilities of the last years to spare the patient unneces-\\nsary side effects and dangerous re-exposure. \\nSome pilot studies reported success when only new drugs are used. In the French\\nTRIO study, 103 extensively pretreated patients with TCF were treated with\\nRAL+ETV+MVC, out of which 86% achieved plasma viremia below 50 copies/ml at\\n48 weeks (Yazdanpanah 2009). In a smaller Italian study with 28 patients on the\\nsame combination RAL+ETV+MVC, this got to 96% after 4 years (Nozza 2014).\\nDoes it necessarily have to be new drugs?

Due to diverging resistance pathways,\\nanother consideration may be to use AZT and TDF. This also applies when patients\\nhave already been treated with these agents. By adding AZT, viral load can be\\ndecreased to below detection in the presence of resensitizing K65R (Stephan 2010).\\nHowever, recent studies evaluating if partially active or inactive NRTIs contribute to\\ntreatment response have yielded conflicting results (Imaz 2011, Scherrer 2011).\\nNNRTIs: In the case of NNRTIs, with less than three NNRTI resistance mutations,\\netravirine seems to be a good option in combination with a boosted PI (most effec-\\ntive with darunavir/r). In other cases it is recommended to discontinue NNRTIs.\\nThere is little doubt that once generated, resistance remains. However, with preg-\\nnant women who have received nevirapine once for transmission prophylaxis there\\nwas no elevated rate of treatment failure on nevirapine-containing regimens if ART\\nwas initiated more than 6 months after delivery – at least theoretically, it seems pos-\\nsible for NNRTI resistances to disappear provided one waits a long enough time\\n(Lockman 2007). However, there is no other data on recycling NNRTIs besides those\\nfor transmission prophylaxis.\\nPIs: In the case of PIs, the boosted PIs darunavir and tipranavir are strongly recom-\\nmended. These PIs probably have distinct resistance profiles. When resistance find-\\nings are unclear, they should be discussed with the virologist. If darunavir/r and\\ntipranavir/r are not available or if they are not tolerated, one can try lopinavir/r;\\nother PIs are probably not suitable.\\nINSTIs: in patients naïve to INSTIs, all three agents, namely raltegravir, elvitegravir\\nand dolutegravir can be considered. If INSTI RAMs are already present, sequencing\\nof raltegravir and elvitegravir makes no sense (DeJesus 2007, Garrido 2012). This\\nseems to be different with dolutegravir. The VIKING trials have shown that higher\\ndoses of dolutegravir (50 mg BID instead of 50 mg QD) may help to overcome\\n raltegravir resistance. In VIKING III, a single-arm, open-label phase III study in which\\ntherapy-experienced patients with INSTI-resistant virus received DTG 50 mg BID\\nwhile continuing their failing regimen (without raltegravir or elvitegravir), viral load\\n6.9.

That way, one could keep the option with the\\nother drug that could be then combined with T-20 in the future. In the case of\\n maraviroc, a recent tropism test should be available. If maraviroc and INSTIs are the\\nonly active agents according to the resistance test, they could and should be admin-\\nistered together. Fortunately, there is no relevant interaction (Baroncelli 2010). If\\nmaraviroc can not be used due to tropism and dolutegravir efficacy seems to be\\nuncertain, one should consider T-20. \\nIt is also important to strategize. What comes after the current regimen, and what\\ncan you do if that fails? To what extent is the patient standing with his back against\\nthe wall, immunologically? How high is the risk of progression to AIDS? The lower\\nthe CD4 T cells and the higher the viral load the more active agents are required to\\ncontrol the virus. If CD4 T cells are very low, it may be better to put all stakes into\\none option with as many active agents as possible (at least two), instead of saving\\nup for future options. \\nSuch complex decisions should be discussed in a team of experienced HIV physi-\\ncians with a virologist who can shed some light onto the resistance situation. The\\ntreating physician should be present as well, as they are familiar with the individ-\\nual situation, know the patient’s adherence history and understand what can be\\nexpected from the patient.\\nPractical tips for salvage therapy \\n\\x81 First question: what is the treatment history, what level of success was there and\\nfor how long? Perform resistance testing (not during treatment interruption).\\n\\x81 Choose as many new active drugs as possible when changing therapy. The less\\noption you have, the more you should combine them.\\n\\x81 Do not add one new drug to a failing regimen. If the clinical and immunologi-\\ncal situation allows, wait for a second active drug.\\n\\x81 Do not wait too long to switch, thus giving the virus the opportunity to develop\\nfurther mutations – the higher the viral load at the time of switch, the more dif-\\nficult the chances for success.\\n\\x81 Do not be too demanding toward the patient! Not everyone is suitable for Mega-\\nART.\\n\\x81 Patients should be treated in larger centers where new drugs and experience are\\navailable. \\n\\x81 Encourage the patient. New treatments may become available soon. A “watch\\nand wait” approach may be possible.\\n\\x81 Do not allow reversion to wild-type virus – even a failing regimen should be con-\\ntinued in the absence of further options.\\nThe following strategies were used with some success. Today, after the introduction\\nof new drugs, however, they play a minor role.\\nDouble PI salvage regimens\\nSince the introduction of darunavir/r and tipranavir/r, double PI regimens have lost\\ntheir standing in salvage therapy. In many double PI regimens, old agents such as\\nindinavir or saquinavir were used. Others were found to be of poor potency, among\\n228 ART'),\n",

Simplifying\\ntherapy should be considered for patients on such regimens. One study showed that\\npatients with stable viral suppression on a double PI can change to darunavir/r as\\nsingle PI without risk (Cohen 2009). This would also save costs as darunavir, albeit\\na more expensive PIs, is still less expensive than two older PIs together.\\nMega-ART with T-20, treatment interruptions\\nIntensified treatment combinations with more than three drugs – often described as\\nmega- or giga-ART – may indeed be effective. Only well-informed and highly moti-\\nvated patients can be considered for mega-ART regimens, and such approaches are\\noften unrealistic in clinical practice. There is some evidence from the small INTENSE\\nstudy that, in some cases, induction with T-20 is of benefit (Clotet 2008). \\nSo, do structured treatment interruptions (STI) before initiation of such intensified\\nregimens provide additional benefit? The answer is clearly no. After some encour-\\naging results from the early GIGHAART Study (Katlama 2004) there is an over-\\nwhelming amount of data showing that STIs do not have a positive effect in heavily\\npretreated patients. In the CPRC064 Study in which patients interrupted treatment\\nfor four months prior to going on a salvage regimen, no differences were found\\nbetween patients who took an STI and those who did not (Lawrence 2003). However,\\nit was disconcerting to see that patients who interrupted treatment not only had\\nworse CD4 counts but also had a significantly higher frequency of severe clinical\\nevents during the follow-up period. Other randomized studies did not find any viro-\\nlogic benefit by interrupting treatment prior to starting an intensified salvage\\nregimen (Ruiz 2003, Beatty 2006, Benson 2006, Walmsley 2007, Holodiny 2011).\\nThis approach is no longer an option. \\nUtilizing NNRTI hypersusceptibility\\nViral strains are considered “hypersusceptible” to certain drugs if the IC50 (50%\\ninhibitory concentration) for the drug is lower than that of the wild-type in phe-\\nnotypic resistance tests. NNRTI hypersusceptibility was first described in 2000\\n(Whitcomb 2000). It generally occurs very rarely with NRTIs but quite frequently\\nwith NNRTIs, and mostly in viruses that have developed resistance mutations against\\nNRTIs (Albrecht 2001, Haubrich 2002). In an analysis of more than 17,000 blood\\nsamples the prevalence of hypersusceptibility in NRTI-naïve patients to efavirenz\\nand nevirapine was 9% and 11%, respectively. In NRTI-experienced patients, it was\\n26% and 21% (Whitcomb 2002). Studies show that NRTI mutations, predominantly\\nat codons 215, 208 and 118, are independently associated with NNRTI hypersus-\\nceptibility (Shulman 2004, Clark 2006).\\nThere seems to be some evidence that patients with NNRTI hypersusceptibility have\\nbetter virologic response (Haubrich 2002, Clark 2006). Even if the real significance\\nand molecular correlates for NNRTI hypersusceptibility remain uncertain, the con-\\nsequence is clear: patients with NRTI mutations (preferably TAMs) and without\\nNNRTI resistance should receive an NNRTI if possible.\\nWatch-and-wait or even simplifying ART\\nSometimes even the most intensified salvage regimen is not effective. Viral load\\ncannot be suppressed to undetectable levels. What should be done in these cases?\\nThe answer is to keep going as long as the patient can tolerate the therapy. Multi-\\n6.9.

A drug such as 3TC also has a positive effect on the viral\\nload even in the presence of a confirmed M184V resistance (Campbell 2005). An\\nItalian study enrolled 50 patients with a viral load of at least 1000 copies/ml on a\\n3TC-containing regimen, with evidence of the M184V mutation and at least\\n500 CD4 T cells/µl (Castagna 2006, Gianotti 2008). Patients were randomized to\\ncompletely interrupt treatment or to continue with 300 mg 3TC alone because the\\nM184V mutation reduces the replicative fitness of HIV. Patients on 3TC indeed had\\na significantly lower increase in viral load (0.6 versus 1.2 logs) and lost significantly\\nless CD4 T cells. The M184V mutation was maintained in all patients on 3TC, and\\nno other mutations accumulated. In contrast, a shift to wild-type was observed in\\nall patients without 3TC. The benefit was sustained until week 144 (Castagna 2007)\\nwhen 3TC was continued on a daily basis. Regarding FTC, daily doses also seems to\\nbe effective, but not when given weekly (Soria 2010). \\nGiven these results, ART should never be stopped completely in very immunocom-\\npromised patients who are then at risk of developing opportunistic infections. In\\nfact, all efforts should be made in such cases to at least partially control the virus.\\nWaiting, even on a suboptimal regimen, is a strategy that can be used to gain valu-\\nable time until new drugs are available. In such cases, ART is not being taken in vain:\\nsuboptimal ART is better than none at all, and some suppression of viral load better\\nthan none. Patients benefit even with only a slight reduction in viral load (Deeks\\n2000, PLATO II). \\nA trial of patients with at least 2500 copies/ml on ART who were randomized to\\ninterrupt or continue ART for at least 12 weeks showed an immunological benefit\\nfor those who remained on their regimen. CD4 T cells dropped only by 15, com-\\npared to 128 cells/µl in patients on an STI (Deeks 2001). In a large cohort study, CD4\\nT cells did not drop as long as the viral load remained below 10,000 copies/ml or at\\nleast 1.5 logs below the individual set point (Lederberger 2004).\\nHow intensively should treatment be continued? Which drugs can be discontinued\\nin this watch-and-wait setting? The quadruple nuke strategys seems to be safe, as\\nindicated by a retrospective study (Llibre 2008). NNRTIs such as nevirapine or\\nefavirenz can be stopped if resistance mutations are found, because replicative fitness\\nis not influenced by NNRTI mutations (Piketty 2004). Moreover, accumulation of\\nfurther RAMs should be avoided as these may compromise newer NNRTIs such as\\netravirine. The same is probably true for integrase inhibitors (Wirden 2009). In par-\\nticular, efficacy of dolutegravir should not be compromised by continuing a failing\\nregimen containing INSTIs such as raltegravir or elvitegravir. \\nWhat about PIs? There is data from a small pilot study showing that PI discontinu-\\nation may be safe (Deeks 2005). 18 patients, in whom the viral load remained high\\ndespite more than 6 months on ART (good compliance, appropriate efficacy), had\\nthe PIs removed from their respective ART regimens while the NRTIs were contin-\\nued. Within the first two weeks, none of the patients had an increase of more than\\n0.5 logs, and even after 16 weeks, no increase was observed in most patients (in only\\n5/18 patients was there an increase of between 0.5 and 1.0 logs; in the others there\\nwas no increase, maybe even a fall). A negative immunological effect was also seen\\nin a few patients, but this was only moderate. Repeated resistance tests showed that\\nall PI mutations persisted in all patients in the first 12 weeks, although PIs were not\\nbeing taken. One retrospective study on HIV-infected children, in which the PIs had\\nbeen discontinued, was based on the same idea as the Deeks study. Here, it was also\\nseen that on continuous NRTI therapy, there was no increase in viral load (LeGrand\\n2005). Another study, however, showed that PIs maintained activity (Opravil 2009).\\n230 ART'),\n",

When to stop ART\\nA review of treatment interruption\\nCHRISTIAN HOFFMANN\\nTreatment interruptions are common. They are an important part of antiretroviral\\ntherapies whether as a clinician one approves of them or not. In the ART\\nCollaboration Cohort (21,801 patients from 18 cohorts from Europe and North\\nAmerica 2002-2009), the probability of treatment interruptions was 11% after three\\nyears of ART (Abgrall 2012). Rates of interruption were markedly higher for intra-\\nvenous drug users (than men who have sex with men) and in patients younger than\\n30 years of age. Many patients have adherence problems. The following chapter pro-\\nvides an overview of the current knowledge in patients with chronic HIV infection.\\nFor treatment interruptions in patients with acute HIV infection, refer to the chapter\\nAcute HIV infection. \\nViral load and CD4 T cells during treatment interruptions \\nAlmost all patients who stop treatment experience a rebound in viral load within a\\nfew weeks, even patients in whom this has been undetectable for several years. Viral\\nload is usually detectable again within 10–20 days (Chun 1999, Davey 1999, Harrigan\\n1999). The viral load in compartments such as the CNS, as well as in semen and\\nvaginal fluids, parallels that in the plasma (Garcia 1999) and is detectable in semen\\nwithin only a few weeks (Ananworanich 2011). Patients should therefore be informed\\nabout the higher risk of transmitting HIV (Burman 2008). Some cases report infec-\\ntions during interruption (Bernasconi 2001). There may be an increased risk of mater-\\nnofetal transmission, even if ART is interrupted in the first trimester (Galli 2009).\\nFrequently, an initial overshooting rebound is observed (De Jong 1997), and only\\nafter a few weeks does the viral load settle to its original, pre-treatment level (Hatano\\n2000). The rebounding virus evidently does not originate from latent reservoirs; other\\ncell populations must exist from which this new virus is produced so quickly (Chun\\n2000, Ho 2000, Imamichi 2001).\\nTreatment interruptions can have serious immunological consequences. Often, CD4\\nT cell counts drop within a short time to pre-treatment levels. The ground that has\\nbeen gained on ART is rapidly lost. The drop is bi-phasic, and the drop more pro-\\nnounced in the first few months (Fagard 2005, Wit 2005, Skiest 2006). CD4 T cell\\nlosses vary greatly between patients but may reach -200 or -300/µl within a few\\nweeks. The higher and faster the CD4 T cells increase on ART, the more rapid their\\ndecline (Tebas 2002). The CD4 nadir is also important. The lower it was and the older\\nthe patient, the more rapidly the count drops again (Maggiolo 2004, Molina 2006,\\nSkiest 2006, Touloumi 2006). Probably there is also an association with high provi-\\nral DNA level at treatment interruption (Piketty 2010).\\nThe loss of CD4 T cells during an interruption may not be regained as quickly. In a\\nprospective study, we saw a significant disadvantage for patients undergoing treat-\\nment interruptions. After a follow up of 18 months, CD4 T cells were more than\\n120/µl less in these patients than in matched patients who had not interrupted treat-\\nment (Wolf 2005). This has also been seen in the SMART trial (see below) and in\\nother studies (Kaufmann 2011). The following examples illustrate that this disad-\\nvantage may persist for a long time. \\n6.10.

As a result, there are concerns that resist-\\nance could develop both during the washout phase of medication (increasing viral\\nreplication with insufficient plasma levels) and on re-initiation of treatment (con-\\ntinued replication despite sufficient plasma levels).\\nHowever, in the case of single treatment interruptions, the probability of this does\\nnot appear to be particularly high, as shown in 1999 by the small French COMET\\nStudy, one of the first studies on treatment interruption (Neumann 1999). But there\\nis no certainty as to whether interruptions might not eventually lead to develop-\\nment of resistant isolates, which merely require more time until they are able to\\ndominate. Mathematical models show that this risk – at least theoretically – is not\\nlow, especially if viral load rises to high levels (Dorman 2000, Bonhoeffer 2000).\\nThe risk of resistance is probably higher for repeated treatment interruptions. In\\nseveral studies, these have led particularly to NNRTI- or 3TC-resistance (Martinez-\\nPicado 2002, Schweighardt 2002, Ruiz 2007). The risk seems particularly high for\\nstrategies involving stopping and starting at fixed intervals (see below). Table 10.1\\ndescribes the example of a patient who was clinically well and who interrupted treat-\\nment. It was probably the repeated stopping and starting of ART that ultimately led\\nto resistance in this case.\\nThe sharp increase in viral load that may often occur can present as a retroviral syn-\\ndrome. The symptoms are similar to acute HIV infection, with lymphadenopathy,\\nfever, asthenia and malaise (Colven 2000, Zeller 2001). Thrombocytopenia occurs in\\n25% of cases, especially when low thrombocytes existed previously (Ananworanich\\n2003, Bouldouyre 2009). The blood count needs to be monitored, especially in\\npatients with a history of thrombocytopenia. \\nFinally, attention should be paid to patients who are coinfected with hepatitis B. If\\nthe HBV treatment with 3TC, FTC or tenofovir is interrupted, HBV rebound can\\nresult in fulminant and life-threatening hepatitis (Sellier 2004, Dore 2010). It is advis-\\nable to monitor these patients very carefully and read the liver enzymes at least every\\ntwo weeks.\\n236 ART\\nFigure 1: CD4 T-cells (black line, left axis) and HIV RNA (grey dashed line, right axis) in two asympto-\\nmatic HIV+ patients.

Autoimmune phenomena in the context of treatment\\ninterruption as seen in this patient have not previously been described\\nThe risk of AIDS seems to be low for single interruptions provided the immune defect\\nis only moderate. In the Swiss Cohort, the risk of progression was not increased (Taffe\\n2002). In 133 patients who interrupted treatment we observed no increased risk of\\nAIDS after 24 months compared to 262 matched controls (Wolf 2005). However,\\nalmost all patients in this study were immunologically stable throughout. The risk\\nis probably higher in patients with severe immunodeficiency (Deeks 2001, Lawrence\\n2003). The CPRC064 Study in which 270 patients with MDR virus and clear immun-\\nodeficiency (median 144 CD4 T cells/µl) were randomized before a salvage regimen\\neither to a four-month treatment interruption or not was stopped because of high\\nrisk of progression. In comparison with the control group, a significantly higher pro-\\ngression to AIDS (17 versus 5) occurred in the group interrupting therapy. In a mul-\\ntivariate analysis, two factors were predictive for death or progression: treatment\\ninterruption and the CD4 T cell count at the time of interruption. The risk increased\\nby 1.4 with every drop of 50 CD4 T cells. This study demonstrates that severely\\nimmunocompromised patients are particularly at risk of developing AIDS during\\ntreatment interruptions of several months. Treatment interruptions should be\\navoided in such patients. Data from the SMART Study show that even with higher\\nCD4 T cells treatment interruptions can lead to the development of AIDS (see below).\\nSTI for immunologic reasons: no effects\\nHardly any patient became as famous as the acutely-infected man treated in a Berlin\\npractice a few years ago who, with a viral load of approximately 80,000 copies/ml,\\nbegan an ART regimen consisting of ddI, indinavir and hydroxyurea. The virus\\nrapidly became undetectable. After several problems – and two short treatment inter-\\nruptions – ART was completely stopped after 176 days. Surprisingly, even without\\ndrugs plasma viremia remained below the level of detection for more than five years.\\nAlthough virus was still detectable in lymph nodes, thus excluding eradication, the\\nimmune system in this case – referred to as the Berlin Patient (not to be confused\\nwith Timothy Brown, another patient from Berlin who had been cures by an allo-\\ngeneic stem cell transplantation) – was obviously capable of durable control of infec-\\ntion (Lisziewicz 1999). But why? Was it the early initiation of therapy, the hydrox-\\nyurea, or the treatment interruptions? No one knows the answer, even today. There\\nmay be a completely different explanation: it is possible that certain host factors in\\nthis patients that have not yet been elucidated could have influenced the course of\\ndisease – completely independently of ART, STI or hydroxyurea (Bloch 2006). \\n6.10.

The theory of “endogenous vaccination” seems plausible.\\nTransient increases in viral load could strengthen HIV-specific immune responses,\\nwhich decline with increasing viral suppression on ART. \\nIn several pilot studies from 2000/2001 successive interruptions seemed to indeed\\nprolong the time to viral rebound or decrease the rate of rebound and, in parallel,\\nthere were measurable improvements in HIV-specific CD4 or CD8 T cell immune\\nresponses (Haslett 2000, Garcia 2001, Lori 2000, Ortiz 1999, Papasavvas 2000, Ruiz\\n2000). However, almost none of these studies included more than 2–6 patients, and\\na control group was usually missing. STIs were finally put to the test in the Spanish-\\nSwiss SSITT Study (Oxenius 2002): 133 patients were monitored throughout four ten-\\nweek treatment cycles, each consisting of eight weeks ART and two weeks of treat-\\nment interruption. After this, ART was permanently interrupted. Treatment success\\n– defined as a viral load below 5000 copies/ml without ART after 52 weeks – occurred\\nin 21/99 patients. However, 5/21 patients had a low viral load even before the ini-\\ntiation of ART. Most importantly, none of the 32 patients with a pre-ART viral load\\nabove 60,000 copies/ml achieved a viral load of less than 5000 copies/ml. The viral\\nload set point was lowered in only a few patients, usually those with low initial viral\\nload, despite repeated STIs. In contrast to acute infection, improvement of HIV-spe-\\ncific immune response seems unlikely in the setting of chronic HIV infection. SSITT\\nclearly showed that treatment interruptions on immunological grounds alone are\\nnot justified and are dangerous.\\nApproaches with immunomodulatory drugs such as hydroxyurea (Foli 2004),\\nmycophenolate (Garcia 2004), steroids (Ulmer 2005) or IL-2 (Henry 2006, Kilby 2006,\\nAngus 2008) took place to lengthen the period of STIs. These approaches have not\\ndelivered positive results or are still in the experimental phases and are not justified\\noutside studies. The same holds true for vaccination strategies (Harrer 2005, Jacobson\\n2006, Goujard 2007, Harrer 2008).\\nSTI as a salvage strategy for MDR virus: obsolete\\nIn most patients with MDR virus, treatment interruption leads to a gradual shift back\\nto wild-type and a loss of resistance. Resistance testing during treatment interrup-\\ntion is often of little use since mutations disappear from the blood as early as two\\nweeks after treatment interruption (Devereux 1999). In modestly immunosuppressed\\npatients, this shift is observed more frequently and faster. In more advanced stages\\nof disease and with a longer duration of treatment, it lasts longer (Miller 2000, Izopet\\n2000), and sometimes after a longer interruption of therapy, no shift can be seen\\n(Halfon 2005). When the shift is visible, PI mutations are the first to disappear, while\\nNNRTI mutations are more protracted because they hardly affect viral fitness (Deeks\\n2001, Birk 2001). It is assumed that the wild-type merely dominates the resistant\\nmutants. Special PCR methods can detect low quantities of resistant virus during STI\\n(Izopet 2000) and when treatment is restarted resistance mutations rapidly re-dom-\\ninate (Delaugerre 2001). Only a few cases have been described in which resistance\\nmutations were apparently flushed out completely. There is one patient (Walter 2002)\\nwho was not able to attain sufficient viral suppression despite intensified ART, who\\nthen interrupted treatment. During the following seven months of treatment inter-\\nruption there was a gradual reversion to wild-type, and after re-starting ART (which,\\naccording to previous resistance testing, should have had no effect) the viral load\\nwas successfully suppressed for several years.\\nCan patients with MDR improve the effect of the salvage regimen if they have had\\na previous interruption of treatment?

However, this data is in contrast to that of numerous other\\nstudies in which an increased risk of AIDS was occasionally seen during treatment\\ninterruptions (Lawrence 2003+2006, Ruiz 2003, Ghosn 2005, Beatty 2006, Benson\\n2006, Walmsley 2007, Holodny 2011). In view of the risk of AIDS and the lack of\\nevidence regarding the benefits, treatment interruptions are no longer justified. \\nSTI for reduction of toxicity\\nEvery antiretroviral therapy can cause side effects. Is it possible to reduce toxicity by\\ntreatment interruptions? Increased transaminases or lipid levels can drop quite\\nrapidly after stopping treatment (Hatano 2000, Wolf 2005). However, it is not clear\\nwhether this is relevant in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. In SMART (see\\nbelow), the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic complications during STIs was\\n actually higher. In contrast to other studies, no relevant improvement of lipids was\\nobserved (Lampe 2010). In SMART but also in other trials, biomarkers for cardio-\\nvascular events were even elevated during treatment interruptions (Baker 2011, Olmo\\n2012). Thus, it seems questionable that, through solitary or repeated interruptions,\\nthe cardiovascular risk profile can be improved.\\nWhat about lipodystrophy and mitochondrial toxicity? At least two studies have\\nshown that, after a few months, mitochondrial DNA can regenerate itself following\\na treatment break (Cote 2002, Mussini 2005, Kim 2007). In contrast, another study\\nshowed no effect (Negredo 2006). Whether or not a clinically manifest lipodystro-\\nphy improves, remains to be seen. At least short treatment interruptions have not\\nhad any effect on morphological changes (Hatano 2000). A six-month ART inter-\\nruption markedly improved adipose tissue function, although fat distribution did\\nnot visibly change (Kim 2007). Substudies from the SMART trial (see below), so far\\nthe largest, showed a moderate positive effect on peripheral fat, lipids and bone\\nmineral density during CD4-guided treatment interruptions (Martinez 2010).\\nAnother subtrial showed more reduction of bone density on continued therapy than\\nduring interruption – however, numbers of a slightly reduced fracture risk during\\ninterruptions are still small (Grund 2009).  \\nConclusion: Although a treatment interruption is theoretically the solution to long-\\nterm toxicity on ART, a convincing argument has not been provided by the data so\\nfar. Nevertheless, we will try to outline some relevant data. It is essential to  distinguish\\nbetween structured intermittent treatment with fixed intervals and interruptions\\nthat are individualized based on CD4 T cell count, in which case the interruption\\nperiod depends on the patient’s immunological situation.\\nStructured Intermittent Treatment (SIT, Fixed Intervals): In the initial phase\\nimmediately following ART interruption the viral load usually remains low. Plasma\\nviremia only reaches pre-treatment levels after about four, sometimes six weeks. The\\nrisk of developing resistance is presumably small at lower levels of viral replication\\n(Bonhoeffer 2000). Does this indicate that ultra-short treatment interruptions could\\nbe utilized to reduce drug use, costs and long-term toxicity? In two NIH pilot studies\\non SIT in chronically infected patients ART was administered as seven days of treat-\\nment and seven days interruption (7-on-7-off). At 44-84 weeks, neither the viral load\\nnor the proviral DNA increased (Dybul 2001+2004). CD4 T cells and HIV-specific\\nimmune responses remained unchanged suggesting that the immune system is prob-\\nably unaffected by such ultra-short breaks in treatment. A significant reduction in\\nlipid levels did, however, occur. Some patients experienced several blips (temporary\\nincreases in viral load) to above 100 copies/ml.

In\\naddition, patients in the NIH studies were carefully selected, with good immune\\nstatus and many years of viral suppression. This strategy is probably only applicable\\nto a selected group of patients. A three-arm study from Thailand showed a negative\\nexperience with the 7-on-7-off approach (Cardiello 2005). In this study, 19/36\\npatients experienced virologic treatment failure within a short period of time, and\\nthis treatment arm was consequently stopped prematurely. The main reason for this\\nappears to lie in the fact that the majority of patients were NRTI-experienced. This\\nmeans that if NRTIs are unstable, such on-off strategies are problematic.\\nART only on weekdays? This approach was taken by the randomized FOTO Study\\n(Five On, Two Off) in which TDF+FTC plus efavirenz was either given daily or from\\nMonday to Friday and stopped at the weekends (i.e., sparing 28%). 60 patients were\\nenrolled who showed an undetectable viral load for at least three months prior to\\nthe study. After 48 weeks, viral load increased in one patient despite low trough levels\\n(Cohen 2007+2009).\\nIn contrast, longer interruptions, over several weeks, with fixed intermittent treat-\\nment seem to be unfavorable. Results from a randomized NIH study with fixed inter-\\nvals (each with one month of STI, two months of treatment) were disconcerting\\n(Dybul 2003). The SIT arm contained significantly more patients with virologic treat-\\nment failure. Resistance mutations developed particularly against NNRTIs and 3TC,\\nso that the study was stopped early. In the SSITT Study (2 weeks STI, 2 months ART)\\nsome resistance was seen (Yerli 2003), likewise in an Italian study (Palmisano 2007),\\nbut not in the French WINDOW Study (two months each of STI and therapy)\\n(Marchou 2006). In the DART trial, the risk of AIDS was increased during the three\\nmonths of treatment interruption (DART 2008). \\nCD4 T cell driven interruptions:Beside fixed intervals, whether short or long, there\\nis another approach whereby interruptions are individualized based on CD4 T cell\\ncount. In other words, in patients with a good CD4 count, ART is interrupted until\\nthe CD4 count drops below some immunological cut-off and only then is it resumed.\\nOver the last few years, many non-randomized studies with differing cut-off points\\nand very heterogeneous patient populations came to the conclusion that this\\napproach is safe and allows for a considerable reduction in drug exposure (Maggiolo\\n2004, Skiest 2004, Fernandez 2005, Mussini 2005). In the meantime, a few ran-\\ndomized studies compare such CD4-driven intervals with continuous administra-\\ntion of ART. The relevant data and results of these studies are given in Table 10.2.\\nIt is clear that the results of these randomized studies differ considerably. While\\nTIBET, Staccato or ACTG 5170 produced the verdict that CD4 T cell-driven inter-\\nruptions are safe, two other studies, Trivacan and SMART came to other conclusions.\\nIn particular, the results of the SMART Study, which started in 2002, caused a sen-\\nsation. In this, the largest randomized HIV study of all time, the cut-off levels for\\nstopping ART were 350 cells/µl, and 250 cells/µl for re-initiating it. In the end, 318\\ncenters in 53 countries recruited a total of 5472 patients. In 2006 an independent\\ndata safety monitoring board concluded that therapeutic interruptions result in an\\nincreased risk of AIDS – in the interruption arm, approximately twice as many AIDS\\nillnesses were observed at follow-up, over an average of 18 months. This included\\nsevere opportunistic infections as well as malignant tumors. In fact, the overall risk\\nwas low, but so significantly elevated that the unusual and far-reaching decision was\\nmade to end the study. \\nIn addition it was observed that cardiovascular incidents in the interruption arm did\\nnot become less frequent, but actually increased. The clinical incidents in SMART\\n(http:/www.smart-trial.org/news.htm) are shown in the following table.\\n240 ART'),\n",

A striking fact was the\\nhigh incidence of clinical occurrences compared to Staccato, a study involving 430\\npatients. As measured by the AIDS/mortality rates of ART, there should have been\\nat least 17 cases in Staccato – instead there was not one. Moreover the significantly\\nhigher risk of an AIDS-defining malignancy during therapy interruption (Silverberg\\n2007) was questionable as the majority of the patients who developed KS or lym-\\nphoma in SMART had already suffered from AIDS illnesses before. Why were these\\npatients enrolled in the SMART study? \\nOne can only speculate about the increased cardiovascular, renal and hepatic inci-\\ndents in the interruption group. How many patients interrupted therapy that should\\nnot have? How many patients with chronic hepatitis B experienced a HBV rebound\\nduring interruption, how many patients with previous HIVAN developed renal prob-\\nlems, how many patients decided to stop concomitant medications (statins) that led\\nto a cardiovascular event? However, there are some newer studies that show an\\nincrease of inflammatory or coagulation parameters during therapy interruption\\n(Kuller 2008, Calmy 2009, Baker 2011, Olmo 2012).

A supervised treatment inter-\\nruption is better than one undertaken without the awareness of the clinician.\\n\\x81 Beforehand, information should be provided on possible clinical (retroviral syn-\\ndrome, AIDS), immunologic (loss of CD4 T cells) and virologic (resistance) con-\\nsequences.\\n\\x81 Patients must be aware that the risk of infection increases – even after a longer\\nsuppression, viral load returns to initial levels after 4-6 weeks without ART.\\n\\x81 Beware of HBV coinfection (danger of hepatitis flare-ups).\\n\\x81 CD4 T cells (including percentage), viral load, and blood count (i.e., thrombo-\\ncytes) should be monitored monthly during interruptions.\\n\\x81 Risk of resistance is possibly higher with NNRTIs (choose robust regimens and\\nstop NNRTIs several days earlier if possible – consider the half-life of the drugs).\\n\\x81 Patients who started ART “too early” according to current standards can proba-\\nbly interrupt safely.\\n\\x81 Resistance testing during treatment interruptions is not useful – it usually only\\nmeasures the wild-type.\\n\\x81 Start with ART again, but not too late. \\nReferences\\nAnanworanich J, Kerr SJ, Vernazza P, et al.

Monitoring \\nCHRISTIAN HOFFMANN, CHRISTIAN NOAH\\nWhich parameters should be included in routine laboratory monitoring of HIV-pos-\\nitive patients? What results can be expected? This section deals with viral load, CD4\\nT cells, routine checks, and plasma levels. Resistance and tropism tests are the subject\\nof a separate chapter (see HIV Resistance Testing). For the tests to be performed on\\ninitial presentation see The New Patient. \\nViral Load\\nViral load is the amount of HIV RNA in the blood. Alongside the CD4 T cell count,\\nviral load has become the most important surrogate marker for HIV infection (Hughes\\n1997, Mellors 1997, Lyles 2000, Ghani 2001, Phillips 2004). It provides information\\non how high the risk is for disease progression. Above all, however, it is the critical\\nvalue in determining the success of therapy. Viral load assays measure the amount\\nof HIV RNA (viral genetic material), which correlates directly with the number of\\nvirions. The units are viral copies/ml (or genome equivalents). This is reported either\\nas a direct whole number or as a logarithmic number. A change of one or more logs\\nrefers to the change in viral load by one or more decimal powers. Many labs provide\\nboth values, the number and the log. Reporting in international units/ml is also\\n possible but in contrast to hepatitis B and C less common. \\nNumber of copies Log 10\\n20 1.3\\n50 1.7\\n100 2.0\\n400 2.6\\n1,000 3.0\\n10,000 4.0\\n50,000 4.7\\n100,000 5.0\\n1,000,000 6.0\\nAssessment\\nThe higher the viral load, the higher the risk of decrease in CD4 T cells, with sub-\\nsequent disease progression or occurrence of AIDS-related illnesses (Mellors 1997,\\nLyles 2000, Phillips 2004). A viral load above 100,000 copies/ml (sometimes even\\nabove 50,000 copies/ml) is considered to be high; a value below 10,000 copies/ml\\n(sometimes below 5000 copies/ml), low. However, these thresholds are not absolute\\nand only provide points of reference.\\nThe effects of plasma viremia on immune status can vary greatly between individu-\\nals. There are some patients whose CD4 T cells remain stable for relatively long\\nperiods despite having a high viral load, while others experience a rapid drop,\\nalthough the viral load is relatively low. Even in the so-called elite controllers in\\nwhich the viral load is undetectable without ART a slow but constant drop in the\\nCD4 cells can be observed (Stellbrink 2008).\\nViral load is probably lower in women than in men. In a meta-analysis, the differ-\\nence was 41% or 0.23 logs (95% CI 0.16-0.31 logs) (Napravnik 2002). The reason for\\nthis phenomenon remains unclear and whether it should have an impact on the\\nindication for treatment is still the subject of debate.\\n246 ART'),\n",

Detection and quantification occurs after\\nbinding of marked DNA fragments. Characteristics of commercially available assays\\nwidely used in laboratories are listed in Table 11.1. The testing systems differ both\\nin levels of detection and in the linear range within which measurement is  reliable\\nor reproducible. The branched DNA (bDNA) method frequently used in the early\\nyears is no longer available.\\nThe market for assay systems is very dynamic. New assay and devices have become\\navailable, existing ones were further developed during recent years. Furthermore,\\nbesides already established manufacturers with expertise in the field, additional\\n diagnostic companies such as Qiagen, Hologic and Cepheid are trying to gain market\\nshare. Experience will show whether their testing systems are reliable or not. An\\nimportant improvement with regard to a higher degree of security is the “dual target”\\nstrategy initially introduced by Roche Diagnostics. This means that not one section\\nof the viral RNA, like before, but two sections can be amplified at the same time. If\\namplification fails in one section on account of the high variability of the HIV\\ngenome (the result in this case would be incorrect negative), it will be amplified in\\nthe second section. \\nRecent further developments also concern a reduction below detection level which\\nis at 20 copies/ml in the most sensitive tests. Clinical relevance of a viral load below\\n50 copies/ml is questionable due to lack of data. It should be noted that a higher\\nsensitivity can lead to insecurity in patients and clinicians and to more frequent\\ncontrol tests. Although intra-assay variability is fairly good for all three methods,\\nmethodological variations should be carefully considered. Differences of less than\\n0.5 logs are not considered significant. A decrease from 4.3 to 3.9 logs, for example\\n(corresponding to a decrease from approximately 20,000 to 8,000 viral copies/ml)\\ndoes not necessarily signify a drop in viral load. The same holds for increases in viral\\nload. Changes of up to threefold can therefore be irrelevant. Patients should be made\\naware of this.\\nConsiderable differences exist between the methods (Coste 1996) and to change from\\none method to another is generally not advisable. Different subtypes are also detected\\nwith varying success according to the method employed (Parekh 1999, Alvarez 2015,\\nNdiaye, 2015). One should be particularly cautious in patients from Africa and Asia\\nwith non-B subtypes in whom the viral load at first presentation can be unexpect-\\nedly low. In such cases, use of a different assay may actually be indicated. However,\\nnewer versions with improved primers and probes are probably superior in measur-\\ning even unusual HIV subtypes with adequate sensitivity. \\nAll assays have a linear dynamic range, outside of which precise numbers are not so\\nreliable. The following rule applies: use one method, one laboratory. The laboratory\\nshould be experienced and routinely perform a sufficiently large number of tests.\\nPre-analytical aspects concerning specimen collection, transport and storage should\\nbe taken into account to ensure correct viral load measurement. In particular, it\\nshould be noted that for obtaining plasma whole blood should be centrifuged within\\nan adequate time interval (optimally within 24 hours). It is recommended to contact\\nthe laboratory ahead of time on these issues. Apparent low-level HIV RNA viraemia\\ncan be related to long sample processing time (Portman 2012).\\nViral load measurement is also vulnerable to contamination. If other examinations\\nsuch as CD4 T cell count is done in the same lab, it is recommended to send a sep-\\narated EDTA tube.\\n6.11. Monitoring    247'),\n",

During active OIs\\nviral load is often high. One study showed a 5- to 160-fold elevated viral load during\\nactive tuberculosis (Goletti 1996). Viral load can also increase significantly during\\nsyphilis and declines after successful treatment (Buchacz 2004, Kofoed 2006, Palacios\\n2007). In a large retrospective study, 26% of transient viremia in patients on ART\\nwere caused by intercurrent infections (Easterbrook 2002). In these situations, deter-\\nmining the viral load does not make much sense. \\nFollowing immunizations, i.e., for influenza (O’Brien 1995) or pneumococcus (Farber\\n1996), the viral load may be transiently elevated (Kolber 2002). As the peak occurs\\none to three weeks after immunization, routine measurements of viral load should\\nbe avoided within four weeks of immunization. It should be noted that not every\\nincrease is indicative of virologic treatment failure and resistance. Slight transient\\nincreases in viral load, or blips, are usually of no consequence, as numerous studies\\nin the last few years have shown (see chapter on Goals and Principles of Therapy). The\\npossibility of mixing up samples always has to be considered. Unusually implausi-\\nble results should be double-checked with the laboratory, and if no cause is found\\nthere, they need to be monitored – people make mistakes. Should there be any doubt\\non an individual result; the lab should be asked to repeat the measurement from the\\nsame blood sample. \\nViral kinetics on ART\\nThe introduction of viral load measurement in 1996-1997 fundamentally changed\\nHIV therapy. The breakthrough studies by David Ho and his group showed that HIV\\ninfection has significant in vivo dynamics (Ho 1995, Perelson 1996). The changes in\\nviral load on antiretroviral therapy clearly reflect the dynamics of the process of viral\\nproduction and elimination. The concentration of HIV-1 in plasma is usually reduced\\nby 99% as early as two weeks after the initiation of ART (Perelson 1997). In one large\\ncohort, the viral load in 84% of patients was already below 1000 copies/ml after four\\nweeks. The decrease in viral load follows biphasic kinetics. In the first phase, i.e.,\\nwithin the first three to six weeks, an extremely rapid drop occurs, followed by a\\nlonger phase during which the viral load gradually decreases further (Wu 1999).\\nThe higher the viral load at initiation of therapy, the longer it takes to drop below\\nthe level of detection. In one study, the range was between 15 days with a baseline\\nviral load of 1000 and 113 days with a baseline of 1 million viral copies/ml (Rizzardi\\n2000). The following figure shows a typical biphasic decrease in viral load after initial\\nhigh levels.\\n248 ART'),\n",

In a study\\non 124 patients, a decrease of less than 0.72 logs after one week was predictive of\\nvirologic treatment failure in more than 99% of patients (Polis 2001). According to\\nanother prospective study, it is possible to predict virologic response at 48 weeks\\neven after 7 days (Haubrich 2011). However, this has little clinical relevance, and in\\nour opinion it is pointless to start measurement of viral load only one or two weeks\\nafter initiation of therapy.\\nMany studies have evaluated the question whether long-term virological success can\\nbe predicted at early phases (Thibaut 2000, Demeter, Kitchen 2011, Lepri 2001).\\nMany of them suggest that changes during the first days after treatment initiation\\nare major correlates of longer-term virological responses. In a study on 124 HIV+\\npatients initiating a PI-based ART, a decline of less than 0.72 logs after 6 days was\\nhighly predictive for consecutive virological failure (Polis 2001). In another prospec-\\ntive trial, week 1 HIV-RNA change was associated with virologic failure above \\n50  copies/ ml at weeks 24 and 48 (Haubrich 2011).\\nHowever, such an early measurement is not clinical routine. We recommend meas-\\nuring viral load every four weeks until it has dropped to below detection of 20–\\n50 copies/ml. Once that is achieved, measurement every three to four months is\\nenough. Eventually, longer intervals are possible (Chaiwarith 2010). In case of\\nrebound, closer monitoring becomes necessary. Within the first 4 weeks of therapy\\ninitiation the viral load should be reduced by a factor of 100, after 3-4 months (6\\nmonths if viral load was high) it should be below the level of detection. Viral load\\ncan also be measured fairly reliably in body fluids other than blood or plasma (for\\nexample cerebrospinal, vaginal or seminal fluid). However, such tests are usually per-\\nformed for scientific purposes and are not officially licensed for other reasons.\\n6.11.

This\\nlymphocyte subpopulation is also referred to as T helper cells. Alongside viral load,\\nmeasurement of the CD4 T cell level is the most important parameter or surrogate\\nmarker in HIV medicine. It allows for a reliable estimate of the individual risk of\\ndeveloping AIDS. Two reference values are generally accepted: above 400–500 CD4\\nT cells/µl, severe AIDS-related diseases are very rare; below 200 CD4 T cells/µl, the\\nrisk of AIDS-related morbidity increases significantly with increased duration of\\nimmunosuppression. Most AIDS-related illnesses occur below 100 CD4 T cells/µl.\\nSeveral points should be considered when measuring CD4 T cells (usually by flow\\ncytometry). Blood samples should be processed within 18 hours. The lower normal\\nvalues are between 400 and 500 cells/µl, depending on the laboratory. Samples should\\nalways be sent to the same (experienced) laboratory. The same applies for viral load\\nas for CD4 T cells: the higher the level, the greater the variability. Differences of 50–\\n100 cells/µl are not unusual. In one study, the 95% confidence intervals with a real\\nvalue of 500 cells/µl were between 297 and 841 cells/µl. At 200 CD4 T cells/µl, the\\n95% confidence interval was between 118 and 337 cells/µl (Hoover 1993).\\nMeasurement of CD4 T cells should only be repeated in the case of highly implau-\\nsible values. As long as the viral load remains below the level of detection, there is\\nno need to be concerned even with decreases in CD4 T cells. In such cases, the  relative\\nvalues (CD4 percentages) and the CD4/CD8 ratio (ratio of CD4 to CD8 T cells) should\\nbe referred to; these are usually more robust and less prone to fluctuation. As a general\\npoint of reference, with values above 500 CD4 T cells/µl, fluctuations of more than\\n29% are to be expected, with less than 200 CD4 T cells/µl fluctuations of up to than\\n14%. Individual laboratories may define the normal ranges for the  relative values\\nand the ratio differently. If there are considerable discrepancies between absolute\\nand relative CD4 T cells, any decisions involving treatment should be carefully con-\\nsidered – if in doubt, it is better to check the values again. The remaining differen-\\ntial blood count should also be scrutinized carefully – is leucopenia or leukocytosis\\npresent? Figure 2 shows CD4 T cells in two untreated patients.\\nClinicians sometimes forget that the result of the CD4 T cell count is of existential\\nimportance for the patient. To go to the doctor and discuss the test results can involve\\na great deal of stress for many patients.

These data support less frequent CD4\\nmonitoring during viral suppression. In the USA, CD4 T cell measurement is con-\\nsidered to be optional in these patients (Whitlock 2013). Patients who might some-\\ntimes insist on more frequent monitoring of immune status can be assured that there\\nare usually no detrimental changes in the CD4 T cell count as long as HIV remains\\nsuppressed.\\nInfluencing factors\\nSeveral other factors can influence CD4 T cell counts apart from laboratory-related\\nvariables. These include concurrent infections, leucopenia of varying etiology and\\nsteroids or other immunosuppressive therapies. Extreme exertion, surgical proce-\\ndures or pregnancy can also lead to lower values. Even diurnal variation occurs; CD4\\nT cells are lower at noon, and highest in the evening around 8 p.m. (Malone 1990).\\nPsychological stress seems to play a negligible role, even though patients often\\nassume the contrary.\\nKinetics of CD4 T cells on ART\\nIf untreated, a continuous CD4 T cell decline is seen in the majority of the patients.\\nHowever, there are discontinuous cases in which the decline may be very rapid after\\na long stable period (see Figure 2). In an observational cohort collaboration study\\non 34,384 ART-naive individuals, the mean CD4 T cell decline was -78 (95% CI, -80\\nto -76) cells/µl per year. The decline was strongly associated with a higher current\\nviral load: for every 1 log10 copies/ml higher, CD4 T cells declined by an additional\\n37.6 cells/µl per year (COHERE 2014). Of note, neither sex, race nor transmission by\\ninjecting drug use was associated with change in either the viral load or CD4 T cell\\ncount. Different kinetics are shown in Figure 3. \\n6.11.

Right: A male patient with a rapid\\ndecline within only a few months in 2012/2013, developing AIDS (toxoplasma gondii encephalitis).\\nWith an earlier initiation of ART (which was started in 2013), this complication could have been avoided.\\nThis case argues for carefully monitoring in untreated patients (grey: relative CD4 T-cells)'),\n",

In a study of almost\\n1000 patients, the CD4 T cell count increased by 21/µl per month during the first\\nthree months. In the following 21 months, this rate was only 5.5 CD4 T cells/µl per\\nmonth (Le Moing 2002). The initial rapid increase in CD4 T cells is probably due to\\nredistribution, which is followed by the new production of naïve T cells (Pakker\\n1998). Diminished apoptosis may also play a role (Roger 2002). It is still being debated\\nwhether the immune system steadily continues its recovery even after a long period\\nof viral suppression, or whether a plateau is reached after three to four years beyond\\nwhich there is less improvement (Smith 2004, Viard 2004).\\nSeveral factors can influence the extent of immune reconstitution during ART. The\\ndegree of viral suppression is crucial – the lower the viral load, the more pronounced\\nthe effect (Le Moin 2002). The absolute increase is higher if CD4 T cell counts were\\nhigh at the start of ART (Kaufmann 2000). Naïve T cells still present at initiation of\\ntherapy are a particularly important factor for long-term immune reconstitution\\n(Notermans 1999). \\nAge is also important (Grabar 2004). The larger the thymus and the more active the\\nprocess of thymopoiesis, the more significant the rise in CD4 T cells is likely to be\\n(Kolte 2002); due to age-related degeneration of the thymus, CD4 T cells in older\\npatients do not increase as much as those in younger ones (Viard 2001). However,\\nwe have seen both 20-year-old patients with very poor CD4 T cell count recovery\\nand 60-year-old patients with very good, above average increases in CD4 T cells.

The following recommendations apply to clini-\\ncally asymptomatic patients with normal results on routine laboratory evaluation,\\nwho have been on stable treatment for several months or who are not taking anti-\\nretroviral therapy. Of course, if treatment is started or changed or if the patient devel-\\nops complaints more frequent monitoring is required. Depending on the problem\\nadditional tests may be necessary. On the other hand, the rate of new lab abnor-\\nmalities decreases as more time elapses post-ART initiation (Taiwo 2012). This sug-\\ngests that as time on initial ART increases, monitoring frequency may be reduced in\\nsubgroups without early abnormalities.\\nA complete physical examination should be performed regularly, and this often leads\\nto the discovery of important findings such as Kaposi’s lesions or mycoses (thrush).\\nThe lower the CD4 T cells, the more frequently patients should be examined.\\nIn patients with less than 200 CD4 T cells/µl, we usually perform fundoscopies every\\nthree to six months to exclude CMV retinitis. Close cooperation with an HIV-expe-\\nrienced ophthalmologist is essential. The better the CD4 T cells, the less often fun-\\ndoscopies are necessary – in our opinion when CD4 counts have normalized these\\ncan be stopped completely. In contrast, regular gynecological examinations with PAP\\nsmears are recommended regardless of CD4 count. Many experts now also recom-\\nmend rectal examination (including proctoscopy) for the early detection of precan-\\ncerous lesions and anal cancer.\\nHowever, such guidelines or recommendations can be interpreted very differently.\\nIn our opinion, in cases of good immune status unless there is a specific suspicion,\\nroutine X-rays, ultrasound examinations (exception: patients with chronic hepati-\\ntis, as hepatocellular carcinoma is not rare in such cases), multiple serologies or lactate\\nmeasurements are not necessary. An annual ECG is only indicated in our view in\\npatients with a specific risk profile (see chapter on HIV and Cardiac Disease ).

Measurement of drug concentrations in\\nserum or plasma is also referred to as therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).\\nSufficient plasma levels are essential for success of virologic treatment (Acosta 2000).\\nIn the VIRADAPT Study adequate PI concentrations were even more crucial than\\nknowledge of resistance mutations (Durant 2000). The importance of sufficient\\nplasma levels has also been shown for NNRTIs (Marzolini 2001, Veldkamp 2001).\\nThis information however dates to the early years of ART.\\nWhether TDM improves virologic response today is not clear (Kredo 2009). Only a\\nfew large randomized studies exist that have provided data regarding this question.\\nOne randomized trial showed no benefit in 183 patients experiencing therapy failure,\\nwho had switched to a new PI and had either adjusted or not adjusted the dose of\\nPIs when their levels were low. After 48 weeks the number of patients with viral loads\\nbelow the limit of detection did not increase with TDM. A positive effect on viral\\nload was merely restricted to a small subgroup of patients with only partial PI effects\\n(Albrecht 2011). Another randomized trial also showed no positive effects on viral\\nsuppression (Best 2007). Favorable effects of TDM continue to remain questionable\\nand the method is still regarded as experimental (Review: Liu 2010). \\nOn the other hand, very high plasma levels correlate with a higher rate of side effects.\\nReported renal problems with indinavir (Dielemann 1999), gastrointestinal disturbances\\nwith ritonavir (Gatti 1999), hepatotoxicity with nevirapine (Gonzalez 2002) or CNS\\nproblems with efavirenz (Marzolini 2001) were all associated with high plasma levels.\\nFor this reason, TDM will remain a tool for therapy observation: not every interac-\\ntion between antiretroviral drugs or with concomitant drugs has been investigated.\\nMeasurement of plasma levels may currently be reasonable in the following situa-\\ntions (German-Austrian ART guidelines):\\n\\x81 Complex drug combinations including boosted PIs \\n\\x81 Patients with very high or low body weight\\n\\x81 Side effects\\n\\x81 Treatment failure (resistance?)\\n\\x81 Suspected absorption or adherence problems\\n\\x81 Severe liver or renal diseases\\n\\x81 ART in children, pregnancy\\n\\x81 Use of new drugs (unknown interactions)\\nSeveral problems associated with TDM limit its broader use. The measurement of\\nNRTIs, for example, is not possible since they are converted to the active metabo-\\nlites only intracellularly. Intracellular measurements are difficult and are not  available\\nin routine clinical practice. There is no valid data available for newer antiretroviral\\nagents such as integrase inhibitors, maraviroc or T-20.\\nMeasuring NNRTIs or PIs may therefore currently determine levels of only one com-\\nponent of a failing combination. Further problems include not only viral strains with\\ndifferent levels of resistance, different inhibitory concentrations, variable protein\\nbinding, and time-dependent variability of plasma levels, but also methodological\\nproblems with the assays, as well as lack of clearly defined limits. Many uncertain-\\nties thus remain in the assessment of therapeutic drug plasma levels. Until data from\\nrandomized studies is available, proving the clinical value of TDM, both the\\n measurement and interpretation of results should be left to specialized centers.\\nBefore performing TDM it is important to consider what the question is to answer.\\nIf efficacy of ART is under evaluation, trough levels are important – trough level\\nshould be measured just before the administration of the next dose. If toxicity is the\\nissue, peak levels 1–3 hours after intake are of interest. \\n6.11. Monitoring    255'),\n",

Prevention of HIV infection\\nCHRISTIAN HOFFMANN\\nApproximately 35 years after AIDS was first described, a prophylactic vaccination\\nremains a distant prospect. In 2007 two highly promising vaccine studies were\\n prematurely halted. Only a few other trials are ongoing. It seems doubtful now that\\na vaccine to effectively prevent HIV infection will be discovered anytime soon – the\\nmoderate but surprisingly successful RV144 vaccine study will not change that (Rerks-\\nNgarm 2009, see chapter on Preventive Vaccination). Several experts believe that a\\npromising vaccine candidate does not exist currently. \\nThe finding that HIV superinfection occurs at approximately the same rate as primary\\nHIV incidence (Redd 2013) has significant implications for HIV vaccine research.\\nWhen HIV itself does not provide any protection from re-infection – how can a pro-\\ntective vaccine for uninfected persons be found? Some experts believe that a vaccine\\nmay never come. Neither blind hope nor overambitious time schedules have proved\\nvery helpful. Some vaccine studies up until now can in fact be regarded as counter-\\nproductive, fatiguing both sponsors and the community.\\nConsidering all this, prevention will continue to be the central means of control-\\nling the HIV epidemic. However, common prevention strategies focused on the ABC\\nguidelines (abstinence, be faithful, condom use) have reached their limits. Despite\\nsignificant efforts – according to UNAIDS, the incidence has dropped from 3.4 million\\nin the year 2001 to 2.1 million new infections in 2013 – the rate of new HIV  infections\\nworldwide remains unacceptably high, highlighting the need for new HIV preven-\\ntion strategies.\\nIn every major city in the US or in Europe syphilis outbreaks in HIV-infected patients\\nhave been reported. Acute hepatitis C among MSM is common. It seems clear that\\nadvertisements and brochures alone are not the solution, especially when these\\nsimple publicity mechanisms are not maintained. High-risk groups are not being\\nreached effectively. Prevention remains an arduous business and success is not imme-\\ndiately visible nor is it profitable in economic terms, although the savings in people\\nneeding treatment, i.e., people not becoming infected, could be enormous. In any\\ncase, sexual behavior is not easily modified by a few advertisements or brochures. \\nFor some time, preventive medicine in HIV has been taking completely new and\\nsometimes unusual paths to reach focus groups. Terms such as serosorting, seropo-\\nsitioning, dipping or strategic positioning show that the medical world is learning\\nto face sexual reality. People have sex and not everyone cares about, follows, or can\\nfollow the ABC guidelines. Recent studies with serosorting, choosing sexual partners\\naccording to perceived HIV serostatus, show that new prevention strategies can be\\ndeveloped (Morin 2008).\\nThe following focuses mainly on medical prevention strategies. In 2010 there were\\ngroundbreaking new findings in this area regarding PrEP and microbicides. In 2011,\\nthe protective effect of ART, which had been expected for a while, finally became\\nevident and now may have a substantial impact on HIV prevention. \\nTreatment as prevention (TasP)\\nLittle in HIV medicine of the last few years has met with such wide response as the\\nresults of the HTPN 052 trial. Spontaneous, standing ovations as seen during the\\nInternational AIDS Conference in Rome in July 2011 are seldom seen in the world\\nof science. The reputable journal “Science” described the results as “the breakthrough\\nin 2011” and “The Economist” even wrote about the “end of AIDS”. What caused\\n258 ART'),\n",

Results of a trial were published in the summer of 2011, which had\\ninvestigated the protective effect of ART (Cohen 2011). HTPN-052 was a trial with\\n1763 HIV-discordant couples in the US, India, Brazil, Thailand and five African coun-\\ntries. The HIV-infected partners were treatment-naïve and had CD4 T cell counts\\nbetween 350 and 550/µl. Approximately 97% of the couples were heterosexual and\\nmost of the volunteers were between 26 and 40 years. The couples received thor-\\nough instructions and the use of condoms was counselled at monthly sessions. Then\\nthe HIV-infected partners were randomized to start ART, either immediately or when\\nCD4 T cells fell to below 250/µl or when AIDS had manifested. The primary end-\\npoint was defined as new infections of the HIV-negative partners that clearly origi-\\nnated from the infected partners (“linked infections”). In a first evaluation in\\nFebruary 2011 after a follow-up of 1.7 years, 39 infections were observed, among\\nthem 28 identified as “linked”. Dramatic differences were observed. There was only\\none infection in the arm in which infected partners had received ART immediately.\\nLater investigations showed that the infection was probably caused before or just\\nafter the infected partner had started ART. Even when counting this case, the results\\ngave evidence for a 96% protection with ART, a result unachieved up to then by any\\nof the other prevention strategies, including PrEP or vaccination (Karim 2011).\\nThus, antiretroviral therapy is an important contribution to prevention, possibly the\\nmost important. However, this was already suggested by a large number of uncon-\\ntrolled studies prior to the HTPN trial. These studies are discussed here briefly:\\n\\x81 In a group of 415 HIV-discordant couples in Uganda 90 new infections were diag-\\nnosed over a period of 30 months. Not a single infection was caused by an infected\\npartner with a viral load below 1500 copies/ml. With every additional log of HIV\\nRNA, infection risk increased by a factor of 2.45 (Quinn 2000). \\n\\x81 In a study in Thailand with 493 HIV-discordant couples, the factor was 1.81. No infec-\\ntionfrom a partner with less than 1094 copies/ml was recorded (Tovanabutra 2002). \\n\\x81 In a study in Spain with 393 heterosexual HIV-discordant couples, a transmission\\nrate of 8.6% was observed between 1991 and 2003. No infection was recorded when\\ninfected partners were receiving combination ART (Castilla 2005).\\n\\x81 Among 534 MSM in San Francisco, infectiousness based on the probability of trans-\\nmission per couple decreased by 60% between 1994 and 1998 (Porco 2004). The\\nHIV incidence decreased in spite of the reported higher number of partners and\\nrisk contacts, even though not all of the HIV+ partners were on ART.\\n\\x81 In a Spanish study with 62 HIV-discordant couples (22 HIV+ women, 40 HIV+ men,\\nall of them on ART), 76 “natural” pregnancies were diagnosed. Not a single HIV\\ninfection of a non-infected partner was recorded (Barreiro 2006).\\nThe above-mentioned clinical studies show clearly that the lower the viral load in\\nthe plasma, the less infectious the patient. In a meta-analysis of 11 cohorts with\\n5,021 heterosexual couples (and 461 HIV transmissions) the transmission rate of\\npatients on ART was 0.46 per 100 person years (5 cases). No transmission was detected\\nfrom anyone who was below 400 copies/ml (Attia 2009).\\nTest and treat?\\nAt the end of 2008 a statistical paper caused great discussion. A research group led\\nby the WHO director Kevin De Cock calculated how to, at least theoretically, curtail\\nand even eliminate the worldwide HIV epidemic (Granich 2008, De Cock 2009). For\\nthis ambitious goal they concentrated totally on the preventive effect of antiretro-\\nviral therapies. They compared the common treatment strategy used today, begin-\\nning ART only on symptomatic patients or on those who have less than a certain\\nnumber of CD4 T cells, to a theoretical strategy that seems simple enough.

The study was based on  population data in\\nSouth Africa, where 17% of the adult population is HIV-infected and on data from\\na successful intervention in Malawi. Other preconditions of the calculation model\\nare that infectiousness of treated versus not-treated patients was estimated at 1%.\\nThe case-reproduction number, the so-called R0 number of new infections caused\\nby one infection, was crucial for this calculation. A simple assumption that an R0 of\\n<1 is required in order to reduce the incidence and to eventually eliminate HIV means\\nthat an incidence rate of less than one new case per 1000 person years was deter-\\nmined in order to eliminate HIV.\\nAt present, every untreated HIV-infected individual causes another 7 HIV infections\\n(R0=7) in the course of their lifetime. R0 could be reduced to 4 if every person received\\nregular treatment with therapy starting at 200 CD4 T cells/µl, or even to 3 if therapy\\nstarts at 350 CD4 T cells/µl. However, an R0 reduction to less than 1 is impossible\\nby this method and curtailing the epidemic with ART alone remains unrealistic. This\\ncould change however, with regular testing and immediate treatment of positively-\\ndiagnosed individuals – elimination of the epidemic could be possible by 2020, even\\nin a country as severely affected as South Africa. Compared with common practice\\nin 2008 where ART is begun only at a certain level of CD4 T cells, immediate treat-\\nment could reduce AIDS mortality to half of today’s number by 2050. Calculations\\nshowed that this initially more expensive strategy could start to be cost-saving by\\naround 2032.\\nThe comments to the WHO publication ranged from “provocative” (Cohen 2008)\\nto “extremely radical” (Garnett 2008). Critics raised concerns over the risks and the\\nabsence of ethics (would all actors agree? Could a restricted individual autonomy be\\ncomplied with? Can changes in sexual habits be maintained?), medical (compliance\\nproblems, the dangers of possible resistance, the side effects and “overtreatment” –\\nstarting too early) as well as financial (South Africa would have to triple their finan-\\ncial commitments) considerations.\\nSuch calculations are not new. Other groups had arrived at similar results in the past\\n(Velasco-Hernandez 2002, Montaner 2006). What is new is that antiretroviral ther-\\napies today are potentially more user-friendly and such programs are  probably easier\\nto put into practice than just a few years ago.\\nIn addition, people are realizing that the current preventive measures can only\\nimprove slowly and that neither vaccines nor microbicides can be expected in the\\nnear future. At present, approximately 80% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa\\nis not aware of their infection. More than 90% do not know if their sexual partners\\nare infected – an invitation for further spread of the epidemic.\\nJuggling figures like this may seem unhelpful at first. Despite all objections regard-\\ning methodological, ethical, financial or logistic considerations, etc., facing 2.1\\nmillion new infections per year, a number that is not likely to decline much in the\\nnear future, and the failure of several vaccine and prevention studies, one thing has\\nbecome clear. Antiretroviral therapy has turned into one of the most important com-\\nponents of prevention. \\nInitiatives like this one of WHO must continue, and new and unusual strategies must\\nbe continually developed. It cannot do harm to bring more therapy to the millions\\nof people worldwide, who still desperately need ART and are not receiving it (see\\nchapter on Global Access).\\nART & viral load in other body fluids\\nDo viral load in plasma (PVL) and viral load in other body fluids correlate? \\nHere are some data on male HIV+ patients::\\n260 ART'),\n",

These 7 patients had been\\non ART for some time.\\n\\x81 In two longitudinal studies on 157 and 88 HIV+ MSM patients on successful ART\\nfor >6 months from France, prevalence of intermittent seminal viral load was 7.6%\\nand 7.5%, respectively (Goshn 2014, Ferraretto 2014). \\nSome more data on female HIV+ patients: \\n\\x81 In 205 HIV+ women with PVL under 400, 400–9999 and over 10,000 copies/ml,\\nthe rate of detectable HIV-1 RNA in the genital tract was 3, 17 and 48%, respec-\\ntively (Cu-Uvin 2000). In 7 ART-naïve women, the viral load decreased by 0.7–2.1\\nlogs within the first 14 days of ART. Similar results were achieved with 11 Brazilian\\nfemale patients (Vettore 2006).\\n\\x81 In a group of 290 women with PVL under 500 copies/ml, 44 (15%) had detectable\\nHIV-1 RNA in cervical smears (Neely 2007). In comparison to PI-containing ART\\nthe risk with NNRTIs was double.\\n\\x81 Out of 122 samples of cervical vaginal lavage, the viral load in the lavage corre-\\nlated highly with PVL (Fiore 2003). However, in 25% of cases, virus was found in\\nthe lavage even when plasma viremia findings proved negative.\\nIn conclusion, in most cases, viral load in plasma parallels viral load in other bodily\\nfluids. If the viral load in plasma decreases, so does the RNA in semen or the vaginal\\nfluid within a short time. However, intermittent shedding can occur in patients on\\nART (1–14%). Although there are implications that the detected virus in semen is\\nnot completely infectious (Nunnari 2002), one cannot rule out the patient being\\npotentially infectious even on successful ART. Genital infections or inflammation\\nmay enhance shedding. In reproductive-aged women, shedding frequency and mag-\\nnitude are greatest immediately following menses and lowest during ovulation\\n(Curlin 2013). \\nPutting together these facts with clinical data, transmission with a low viral load\\nseems unlikely. To date, only a few cases have been recorded in which transmission\\nhas taken place despite effective ART (Stürmer 2008). These cases show that there is\\nin fact a residual risk. The question is how to manage that risk.\\nThe EKAF paper\\nIn January 2008 a paper was released by the “Eidgenössische Kommission für Aids-\\nFragen” (EKAF), the Swiss AIDS commission.

The probability of infection is certainly under 1:100,000, but nevertheless not\\nzero (Wilson 2009). The preventive effect of ART may be endangered by higher risk\\ntaking. According to mathematical models, a 10% rise in risk behavior could counter\\nthe effects of ART (Blower 2001, Law 2001). However, a meta-analysis came to the\\nconclusion that ART does not increase risk behavior of the patient, even if the viral\\nload is below detection (Crepaz 2004).\\nHIV clinicians must be prepared for this discussion. Patients are asking more ques-\\ntions: do I have to use a condom for the rest of my life? Here, it is better to give indi-\\nvidualized advice. It depends greatly on the non-infected partner as well, as he or\\nshe should not be pressured. On the other hand, information of this type can be a\\nrelief for many patients and their partners. The EKAF paper may also motivate high-\\nrisk patients to finally start antiretroviral treatment (preventing more infections\\nrather than causing new ones initially feared by the release of the paper). \\nHowever, it must be repeated that the EKAF statement refers only to stable rela-\\ntionships. Safer sex is still recommended, especially with occasional sexual contacts\\nto avoid other sexually transmittable diseases.\\nThe PARTNER Studies \\nHow high is the transmission risk in reality? The European PARTNER Study is address-\\ning this issue. PARTNER is a large observational multi-centre study of 1,110 HIV\\nserodiscordant couples in which the positive partner is on ART and who do not\\n routinely use condoms. Results presented at CROI 2014 from a planned interim\\nanalysis, reported that no linked transmissions have so far occurred after almost 900\\ncouple years of follow-up. Follow-up results included almost 44,500 times with sex\\nwithout condoms and over 21,000 times when this was with anal sex (Rodger 2014).\\nHowever, uncertainty over the upper limit of risk remains, particularly over recep-\\ntive anal sex with ejaculation. Moreover, PARTNER provides only evidence to date\\non the level of risk for people who have already been having sex without condoms\\n(sometimes for many years). Thus, the findings in this study may not apply 1:1 to\\nothers. Additional follow-up in MSM is needed through PARTNER2 (2014–2017) to\\nprovide more precise estimates for transmission risk to inform policy and also\\n individual choice on condom use.\\nMedical prevention strategies besides ART\\nIn general, the risk for sexual transmission of HIV is relatively low and lower than\\ncommonly thought. According to a recent meta-analysis, the current per-act risk of\\nHIV transmission via sexual exposures ranges from 4 per 10,000 exposures for inser-\\ntive penile–vaginal intercourse to 138 for receptive anal intercourse (Patel 2014). The\\nestimated risk of HIV acquisition from sexual exposure was attenuated by 99.2%\\nwith the dual use of condoms and antiretroviral treatment of the HIV+ partner. Thus,\\ntransmission is a relatively infrequent event. This necessitates studies on large patient\\ncollectives and/or extended observation periods, in order to access the effectivity of\\nmedical prevention strategies. Some of these studies will be discussed here. \\nCircumcision\\nCircumcision of the male foreskin reduces the risk of infection for several diseases\\nin unprotected sexual intercourse (Weiss 2006). At least three randomized trials with\\nheterosexual males in Uganda, Kenya and South Africa demonstrated this in recent\\nyears for HIV as well. Remarkably similar results were achieved (Table 12.1).\\nA meta-analysis of these studies shows a relative risk of 0.44 for circumcision (Mills\\n2008). The NNT (number needed to treat) required to prevent an event reached a\\nrelatively low 72.\\n262 ART'),\n",

Circumcision reduces the  frequency\\nof genital HSV-2 infection (Tobian 2008), which however does not explain the pro-\\ntective effect (Gray 2009). An estimated 2 million HIV infections in Africa alone\\ncould be prevented in the next few years (Williams 2006). The WHO recommends\\ncircumcision as a preventive means for heterosexual men. A favourable side effect is\\nthat circumcision also has a protective effect against HPV-infections (Serwadda 2010,\\nDavis 2013). \\nCircumcision, however, is not without risk. Complications (infections, postopera-\\ntive bleeding) occur in 3–4% of cases (Gray 2007). Sexual behavior after circumci-\\nsion, ethics and logistical problems are only a few aspects (Lie 2006). It must be noted\\nthat circumcision reduces the risk for male but not for female partners. The\\n randomized study in Uganda showed a slight increase in infections of the female\\npartners of circumcised males (Waver 2008). This can be mainly explained by couples\\nprobably having sexual intercourse earlier than recommended. Several weeks of absti-\\nnence are stipulated after the operation.\\nIs there a protective effect for MSM after circumcision? If there is, the data is less\\nclear compared to the results for heterosexual men. A meta-analysis of 15 greatly\\nvarying studies with 53,567 MSM (52% with circumcision) showed no significant\\ndifference between circumcised and uncircumcised males (Millet 2008). Another\\nnewer study confirms these results (Sanchez 2011). Taken together, it remains unclear\\nwhether the protective effects of circumcision apply to the MSM population.\\nPreventive treatment of HSV and other diseases\\nGenital infections clearly increase the risk of acquiring HIV. For example, in a large\\nprospective trial, bacterial vaginosis was associated with a greater than 3-fold\\nincreased risk of female-to-male HIV-1 transmission (Cohen 2012). Even more rele-\\nvant is human herpes virus 2 (HSV-2) as this common virus can be easily detected\\nand quantified in genital fluids.. Genital HSV-2 infection is associated with increased\\ncervicovaginal and plasma RNA among coinfected women with genital ulcers, inde-\\npendently of the level of immunodeficiency (LeGoff 2007). According to a meta-\\nanalysis, the risk of HIV increases with HSV-2-seropositivity: when HSV-2 antibod-\\nies are detected in the blood, the risk increases in male patients 2.7-fold and in female\\npatients 3.1-fold (Freeman 2006). A considerable amount of new HIV infections are\\ndue to HSV coinfection, with an estimated 38–69% in female patients and 8–49%\\nin male patients. Considering these data, several studies have been conducted in\\nwhich the protective effect of HSV therapy has been evaluated both in HIV-negative\\nand HIV-positive populations.\\n6.12.

HPTN 039, a double-\\nblind, randomized, Phase III trial investigated this question (Celum 2008). In total,\\n1871 MSM from the USA and Peru and 1,380 women from Zimbabwe, Zambia and\\nSouth Africa received 400 mg acyclovir or placebo twice daily. Enrolled subjects were\\nall HIV-negative and HSV-2-positive at the beginning of the trial. Although less HSV\\nulcers were observed in the active group, the trial failed to show a decline in HIV\\nincidence in the acyclovir -group, with 3.9/100 person-years compared to 3.3/100\\nin the placebo group. These disappointing results were confirmed by the Mwanza\\ntrial with 821 women in Tanzania, in which again no decline was observed (Watson-\\nJones 2008). It is still not clear why, however, resistance to acyclovir is unlikely\\n(Watson-Jones 2010). Another study showed that short bursts of subclinical genital\\nHSV reactivation are frequent, even during high-dose anti-herpes therapy, and prob-\\nably account for continued transmission of HSV during suppressive antiviral therapy\\n(Johnston 2012). Taken together, preventing HIV infection with HSV therapy using\\nacyclovir in HIV-negative individuals has proven unsuccessful. The prophylactic use\\nof azithromycin, to prevent bacterial STDs also showed no protective effect against\\nHIV (Kaul 2004).\\nHSV treatment of HIV+ patients: Can the transmission rate be reduced if the HIV+\\npartner is treated with acyclovir? A huge study enrolling 3408 discordant African\\ncouples showed no effect on the transmission rate, although there was a clearly\\nreduced rate of genital HSV ulcers (Celcum 2010). However, this study did show an\\ninteresting side effect, that there is a slight but measurable effect with acyclovir and\\nits derivatives regarding HIV viral load. Compared to placebo, a decline of 0.25 logs\\nwas observed. This effect slightly decreased the risk of HIV progression in treatment-\\nnaïve patients (Lingappa 2010). The transmission rate was obviously not influenced\\nby the reduction in viral load. Resistances were not induced by acyclovir (Baeten 2011). \\nAntiviral effects were also observed in several other randomized studies. The viral\\nload in blood and cervicovaginal fluids was reduced by 0.26 to 0.53 logs by using\\nacyclovir or valacyclovir (Nagot 2007, Zuckermann 2007, Baeten 2008, Dunne 2008,\\nDelany 2009, Paz-Bailey 2009, Roxby 2012). Valacyclovir also significantly decreased\\nearly breast milk HIV-1 RNA among women receiving PMTCT (Drake 2012). In a\\nmeta-analysis of seven randomized trials conducted between 2000 and 2009 in which\\nacyclovir or valacyclovir were used as prophylaxis among individuals coinfected with\\nHIV-1 and HSV-2, the summary treatment effect estimate was -0.33 logs, an approx-\\nimate halving of plasma viral load (Ludema 2011). This effect may be enhanced with\\nhigh doses of valacyclovir. Of note, the incremental reduction in plasma HIV-1 RNA\\nachieved with valacyclovir was not mediated by greater genital HSV-2 suppression\\n(Perti 2013). \\nThus, these studies may possibly lead to the development of new acyclovir derivatives\\nwith improved antiviral potency, provided they respond well to HIV (Vanpouille 2010).\\nMicrobicides, lubricants, diaphragms\\nMicrobicides are chemical agents, mostly of topical application, in the form of gels\\nthat kill or immobilize HIV and other diseases. Heterogenic mechanisms are being\\nexamined, among them are agents that inhibit docking to the target cell or antivi-\\nral agents. Microbicides will need to be inexpensive, easy to apply non-toxic, and\\neffective against other STDs, as these increase the risk of HIV transmission. The\\nCAPRISA trial (see below) led to a revival in this field of research.\\nClassical microbicides: Up to now, there is no product that has delivered convinc-\\ning protective effects in clinical studies.

PRO 2000,\\nwhich initially seemed promising (Abdool Karim 2011), had no effect (McCormack\\n2010). Application of diaphragms and/or lubricants in addition to condoms had no\\nprotective effect, as one randomized study showed (Padian 2007).\\nAntiretroviral microbicides: A breakthrough in research of microbicides was\\nachieved in 2010 in the CAPRISA trial, a double-blind study in which 889 HIV-neg-\\native women in South Africa used 1% tenofovir gel (Abdol Karim 2010). Compared\\nto placebo, HIV incidence was reduced from 9.1 to 5.6/100 years. Transmission risk\\nfor women applying the gel regularly was reduced by 54% and safety and tolerabil-\\nity were pretty good (Sokal 2013). According to newer estimations (Williams 2011),\\nover 20 years, the use of tenofovir gel in South Africa could avert up to 2 million\\nnew infections and 1 million AIDS deaths. Even with low rates of gel use, it is highly\\ncost-effective and compares favorably with other control methods. \\nThis first success (“proof of concept”) has led to a focus on antiretroviral agents in\\nthe research of microbicides, such as tenofovir and even the more experimental\\nNNRTIs dapivirine and MIV-150, as well as maraviroc and raltegravir (Review:\\nMertenskötter 2011).\\nPrEP (Pre-exposure Prophylaxis)\\nPrEP is an oral prophylactic antiretroviral treatment. It is a novel strategy to stem\\nthe spread of HIV with ARVs (mainly used: TDF or TDF+FTC) in at-risk HIV-negative\\npopulations such as MSM, female sex workers or injecting drug users. In contrast to\\nPEP (post-exposure prophylaxis, see chapter on PEP), PrEP attempts to prevent trans-\\nmission before the exposure occurs. The impetus for the development of PrEP was\\nthe successful use of prophylaxis for mother-to-infant transmission, as well as animal\\nstudies. However, early studies were regarded with skepticism. Pressured by activists\\nand others, a study with Cambodian sex workers was interrupted in 2004 and others\\nin Cameroon and Nigeria in 2005 (Cohen 2004, Sing 2005). Researchers were accused\\nof not providing sufficient information to the participants and of discontinuing treat-\\nment once the study was over.\\nA breakthrough was seen with PrEP at the end of 2010. In the iPrEx Study, 2499 MSM\\nfrom six countries received either TDF+FTC or placebo. After a median of 1.2 years,\\n36 versus 64 infections were observed and the risk for infection was reduced by 44%\\n(Grant 2011). Apart from slightly more cases of nausea and weight loss in the active\\narm, there were no differences. Of note, only in 3/34 patients of those infected in\\nthe active group was tenofovir or FTC detected in plasma. Protective effects were also\\nproven in the Partners PrEP trial, a large trial involving 5000 heterosexual couples\\nin Kenyia and Uganda, and the TDF2 trial (Thigpen 2011, Baeten 2012+2014). In\\nthe Partners PrEP trial, the placebo arm was stopped in July 2011 and the subjects\\nre-randomized to tenofovir or TDF+FTC. In the Bangkok Tenofovir Study, daily oral\\nTDF reduced the risk of HIV infection in people who inject drugs. Among 2413 par-\\nticipants, 1204 on TDF and 1209 on placebo, 17 and 33 participants became infected\\n(incidence of 0.35 and 0.68 per 100 person-years), indicating a 49% reduction in\\nHIV incidence (Choopanya 2013).\\nThese results, however, have not been without their setbacks. In the FEM-PrEP Trial\\non African woman, 35 infections in the placebo arm were observed compared to 33\\nwith TDF+FTC. Due to lack of efficacy, this large trial was discontinued in April 2011.\\nThe three-armed VOICE Trial investigating women from three African countries also\\nshowed no benefit with different interventions, neither with TDF gel, TDF tablets\\nnor with TDF+FTC (Marrazzo 2013).

However,\\nadherence certainly has a strong influence. Simple truth: One can not expect a pro-\\ntective effect if the patient doesn’t take the agent. Trials such as iPREX or PARTNERS\\nPrEP showed a clear correlation between blood levels and infection risk. Protection\\nwas highest in volunteers with detectable tenofovir levels (Anderson 2012, Donnel\\n2012, Baeten 2014). In the Bangkok Tenofovir Study, the risk of HIV infection\\ndecreased as adherence improved, from 48.9% overall to 83.5% for those with at\\nleast 97.5% adherence (Martin 2015). Adherence was poor in the FEM-PrEP trial, as\\nthe young women considered their risk of acquiring HIV  infection as minimal. The\\nVOICE trial also showed poor adherence as probably the application of gel was con-\\nsidered inconvenient by participants. \\nWhat has become clear however is that continuous PrEP is not always beneficial and\\nthat success depends on several factors: first, adherence, but also viral load of the\\ninfected sexual partner, other STDs, different biological factors, sexual behavior and\\nsexual practices, to name just a few. Hormonal contraceptives seem to have no influ-\\nence on the transmission rates (McCoy 2012). There are also some concerns about\\nsafety. Several studies suggested that tenofovir-based PrEP moderately but signifi-\\ncantly reduces bone density and renal function (Mugwanya 2015, Mulligan 2015).\\nAnd what about development and transmission of resistance in an unidentified HIV\\ninfection? Fortunately, drug resistance was rare in iPrEx on-study seroconverters, and\\nonly as low frequency minor variants (Liegler 2014). In PARTNERS PrEP, however,\\n5/26 seroconverters with detectable plasma drug levels had virus with resistance\\nmutations associated with their PrEP regimen, mainly M184V (Lehman 2015).\\nIn early 2015, two randomized trials (PROUD and Ipergay) provided further evidence\\nfor the efficacy of PrEP in high-risk populations. In a pragmatic open-label trial, the\\nPROUD Study, PrEP was evaluated in MSM in a real-world setting, and the use of\\npublic clinics, with minimal extra research funds, was key to its design (McCormack\\n2015). In total, 545 MSM reporting anal intercourse without condoms in the previ-\\nous 90 days were randomized to receive open-label daily TDF+FTC either immedi-\\nately (IMM) or after a deferral (DEF) period of 12 months. In October 2014 the DSMB\\nrecommended that all MSM in the deferral group be offered PrEP. At this point, 3\\n266 ART'),\n",

In total, 400 high risk adult MSM\\nwho reported anal sex without condoms were randomized to take two pills of\\nTDF+FTC or placebo 2 to 24 hours before each sexual intercourse, then another pill\\n24 hours later and a fourth pill 48 hours after the first drug intake (Molina 2015).\\nIn November 2014, after a median follow-up of only 8.8 months, the placebo arm\\nwas also discontinued as the incidence of HIV-infection was 6.75 versus 0.94 per 100\\npatient-years in the TDF+FTC arm, indicating a relative reduction of 86% in the inci-\\ndence of HIV with on-demand PrEP. Sixteen patients had acquired HIV infection\\nafter enrollment, 14 in the placebo arm and 2 in the TDF/FTC arm.\\nTaken together, PrEP represents a very effective and safe prevention strategy if the\\nperson is adherent. In July 2012, FDA approved TDF+FTC to reduce the risk of HIV\\ninfection in uninfected individuals who are at high risk of HIV infection and who\\nmay engage in sexual activity with HIV+ partners. In July 2014, the WHO released\\nguidelines recommending the offer of oral PrEP to high-risk populations\\nhttp://www.who.int/hiv/pub/guidelines/keypopulations/en/. In Europe, where\\nTDF+FTC are not yet available for prevention, community organisations are  currently\\ncalling stakeholders to make PrEP available and accessible.\\nEvaluation of long-acting medications and alternative formulations for PrEP is under-\\nway and may lead to the wider implementation and impact of PrEP. Physicians must\\nbe prepared to talk about PrEP. Patients and their partners will be asking for it.\\nHowever, many questions remain that have not been answered by the above-men-\\ntioned studies. \\nHow should PrEP be administered? And who will cover the expense? Will PrEP be\\nsold on the black market? Who should distribute it (walk-in clinics, doctors, phar-\\nmacists?) and how to make it more accessible to high risk groups? What compose\\nthese high risk groups? Will the success of PrEP lower the use of condoms? Is the\\ndose studied and the form (every day or before and after sex as “on-demand”) the\\nbest way? Is TDF+FTC the only option? Other questions regarding long term toler-\\nance, safety during pregnancy, administration in young people or patients with hep-\\natitis B remain unanswered. \\nReferences \\nAbdool Karim Q, Abdool Karim SS, Frohlich JA, et al.

Global access to HIV treatment\\nROB CAMP\\nWe all know this data, which we see every time we go to an international meeting: \\n\\x81 Some 5,600 people become infected with HIV every day, 600 of whom are under\\n15 years of age, half of them are women, 30% are under 25. \\n\\x81 Approximately 15 million people are currently receiving ART, and while that is\\nmore than laudable (just three years ago it was half that!), the rest (approx. 21\\nmillion) are waiting, or do not know they have HIV. \\n\\x81 There are some 36.9 million people infected, 2.0 million newly infected in 2014.\\n1.2 million people died of AIDS-related causes in 2014.\\n\\x81 An investment of $35 billion/year is envisioned for the global “fast track” response\\nby 2020.\\nAccess to drugs depends not only on financial and human resources. It depends also\\non people being aware of their HIV status, knowledgeable about treatment, and\\nempowered to seek it. Thus public information and education are important  elements\\nin widening access, alongside efforts to build or strengthen health services. Stigma\\nhas been and remains a major stumbling block in wanting, seeking and taking the\\ntreatment regimen correctly. The campaign for universal access to life-saving drugs\\nfor HIV and AIDS, started originally by grassroots AIDS activists, is today a major\\nfocus of attention of UN agencies and most all influential organizations at national\\nand global levels. \\nThe Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, unanimously endorsed by the UN\\nGeneral Assembly in 2001, embraced equitable access to care and treatment as a\\n fundamental component of a comprehensive and effective global HIV response. Since\\nthen many countries, through the support of intergovernmental organizations and\\ndonors, have definitively demonstrated the ability to deliver HIV treatment in very\\nresource-limited settings. Access to treatment has helped mobilize communities in\\nresponse to HIV , preserved the health and viability of people and households\\n vulnerable to HIV , and strengthened HIV prevention efforts in many parts of the\\nworld. The UN underscored this goal in 2011, upholding their belief in TRIPS\\n flexibility regarding public health drugs and global trade agreements.\\nIn the goal to reach universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support,\\nleadership at a national level is required to establish policies that support treatment\\nscale-up, and is now a very central part of being able to achieve the new funding\\nlevels needed to eradicate HIV: \\n\\x81 increasing the number of people who choose to know their HIV status; \\n\\x81 reducing HIV stigma; \\n\\x81 building human capacity to sustain treatment through education and training and\\nbetter use of human resources; \\n\\x81 improving supply management and integrating HIV care with other health services.\\nIn 2012, the international community committed to a new goal of 15x15, 15 million\\npeople on ART by 2015, which was reached some 9 months ahead of target. The goal\\nof universal access is also part of Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 6 which\\nincludes halting and beginning to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015. \\nThe updated 2011–2015 global health strategy was released in June 2011. This strat-\\negy outlines four key targets that countries need to achieve if universal access and\\nMDG 6 are to be realised: reduce new infections by 50 percent among young people\\n(15–24 years), reduce TB-related mortality by 50 percent, eliminate new infections\\nin children, and reduce HIV-related mortality. And of course, the 90/90/90 program,\\nof having 90% of those with HIV tested, 90% of those tested starting treatment, and\\n90% of those undetectable.\\n272 ART'),\n",

During PEPFAR’s initial phase in 2004–2008, the United\\nStates invested nearly $19 billion in PEPFAR (which includes bilateral HIV/AIDS and\\ntuberculosis programs, as well as contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\\nTuberculosis and Malaria). For 2015, $6.83 billion was enacted for bilateral HIV/AIDS\\nprograms (see chart; $ here are US$).\\nPEPFAR is the cornerstone of the US Global Health Initiative, which has committed\\nalmost $66 billion to support countries in improving and expanding access to health\\nservices. PEPFAR focuses now on sustainability, and serves as a platform for expanded\\nresponses to a broad range of global health needs. PEPFAR partnerships in more than\\n70 countries have directly supported care for millions of people affected by HIV/AIDS. \\nUntil July 2015, PEPFAR supported prevention of mother-to-child transmission pro-\\ngrams that allowed more than 1,000,000 infants of HIV+ mothers to be born without\\nHIV. PEPFAR has also directly supported HIV counseling and testing for nearly 56.7\\nmillion people, including community-based services and rapid tests, providing what\\nmay be an important entry point to prevention, treatment, and care. \\nTable 13.1: FY 2009 – FY 2015 PEPFAR Funding ($ in millions)\\nPrograms 2009 2010 2011 2 2012 2013 2014 2015 Total\\nBilateral HIV/AIDS Programs1 5,503 5,574 5,440 5,333 4,726 4,940 5,238 51,791\\nGlobal Fund 1,000 1,050 1,046 1,050 1,569 1,650 1,350 11,968\\nBilateral TB Programs 177 243 239 256 233 243 242 2,163\\nTOTAL PEPFAR (w/o Malaria) 6,680 6,867 6,725 6,639 6,527 6,833 6,830 65,921\\n1 Bilateral HIV/AIDS Programs includes funding for bilateral country/regional programs, UNAIDS,\\nIAVI, Microbicides and NIH HIV/AIDS research. \\n2 Includes enacted funding for FY 2009-2015.\\nNote: All funding amounts have been rounded to the nearest million, so the numbers shown in the\\ntable may not sum to the totals. *Accessed September 2015\\nPEPFAR will have dispersed more than 1 billion condoms in the years 2012 and 2013.\\nThe commitment to voluntary male circumcision has grown to reach 6.5 million\\nmen.

Total new grants for 2014 fell by close to 25%, to $2.5\\nbillion due to the transition to this new funding model and better cash management\\nprocedures of moneys already disbursed. There is almost ¾ of another billion USD\\nsigned but not committed to. \\nFrom their 2014 Press Statement on Results, “Through the (new) funding model, the\\nGlobal Fund is pursuing a differentiated approach to investing. It is weighing eco-\\nnomic scenarios against epidemiological intelligence that points to diseases, espe-\\ncially HIV and tuberculosis, becoming less generalized and more concentrated in\\ncertain locations and in key populations within a country. While certain middle-\\nincome countries and regions are making remarkable progress, others are falling back.\\nAchieving control over these diseases calls for a diversified and differentiated\\napproach, aligned with the Post-2015 development agenda.”\\nFinland, Greece, Hungary, Slovenia and Spain are some of the European countries\\nwith zero GFATM contributions from 2014–2016. Ireland and Italy are in the\\n“promised but not yet paid” column.\\nUNAIDS\\nUNAIDS provides technical support to countries, assisting them with expertise and\\nplanning for national AIDS programs, to help ‘make the money work’ for the people\\non the ground. UNAIDS tracks, evaluates and projects the financial resource require-\\nments at global, regional and country levels to generate reliable and timely infor-\\nmation on the epidemic and the response. Based on these evaluations, UNAIDS pro-\\nduces guidelines and progress reports. Much of the international data we juggle is\\nset and approved by UNAIDS. They set out plans for “Getting to Zero” and other\\nplatitude-ridden slogans and programs. They are making a good effort on tackling\\nmajor social issues like homophobia, financial sustainability and gender equality.\\n“Together we will end AIDS”, whose title is annoyingly cheerleader-ish, actually offers\\nsome really important information like the fact that low- and middle-income coun-\\ntries now invest significantly in their HIV/AIDS response, while donor countries have\\nnot increased much. The UN adopted a Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS in which\\nmember states agreed to increase investments for HIV to between $22–24 billion by\\n2015. A concerted effort by all countries is needed to meet the targets (slightly under\\n$22B has been reached up until June 2015). Another promising approach would be\\nto expand innovative mechanisms like indirect taxation (airline tickets, mobile\\nphone usage, exchange rate transactions) to support global health initiatives, includ-\\ning HIV. The larger international community must continue to support and\\nstrengthen existing financial mechanisms, including the Global Fund and relevant\\nUN organizations. The 15x15 program is a UNAIDS-sponsored program, as is the\\n90/90/90 idea, mentioned above and further on.\\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation\\nThe largest private philanthropic organization is located in Seattle, US, “focusing on\\nimproving people’s health and giving them the chance” to emerge from “hunger\\nand extreme poverty.” They have approximately 1376 employees with an endow-\\nment of $42.9 billion. They have committed $33.5 billion since inception and in\\n2014 committed grants to the tune of $3.9 billion in over 100 countries (the 2013\\nannual report at http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Who-We-Are/Resources-and-\\nMedia/Annual-Reports).

As HLA testing\\nfor abacavir HSR is not easily available in the Global South, it is very important to\\ntrain both the medical professional as well as users on diagnosis of HSR and what\\nto do if it occurs, and the importance of never re-starting it once HSR is suspected,\\nthings that from an international regulatory agency would be hard to monitor.

In 2014, the cost of a regimen of AZT+3TC+\\natazanavir/r, is $243 in low-income countries and significantly higher in middle-\\nincome countries. Prices paid for second-line regimens can vary significantly between\\ncountries. \\nIn the UK, a study showed that first-line treatments can last 8 years or longer (UK\\nChic 2010).

What to do with the\\npeople who need to move to a new regimen (whose number is growing now that\\neveryone should be on treatment)? Of the regimens that fail, NNRTIs fail at a rate\\nalmost three times higher than the rate of PIs. Most people in resource-limited set-\\ntings are on an NNRTI-containing regimen (nevirapine or efavirenz). MSF estimates\\nthat regimen failure is “largely under-diagnosed” due to limited lab facilities for viral\\nload testing, which can only lead to resistance and harder-to-construct post-first-line\\nregimens.\\nHow to expand treatment to more people plus switch those currently failing to a\\nmore expensive second-line regimen, all within a framework of cutting back on donor\\nspending? \\nAs the absolute numbers of people who need access to second-line regimens  continue\\nto grow, addressing the high cost of second-line regimens will become increasingly\\nimportant to ensure the cost-effective use of available resources.

Management of Side Effects\\nTHOMAS BUHK UND CHRISTOPH D. SP INNER\\nAntiretroviral Therapy (ART) has become more and more tolerable. Side effects has\\nbeen become less frequent and less severe. While in the past up to 25% of ART\\n disruption due to side effects were observed within the first year of ART (d’Arminio\\nMonforte 2000, Yuan 2006), treatment cessation due to side effects has become less\\nfrequent (Carr 2009, Cooke 2014).\\nNevertheless side effects and tolerability play an important role within clinical care\\nof HIV+ patients. Regular visits help to address this factor for improving treatment\\nsuccess. Biannual visits are recommended by most current guidelines. Standard eval-\\nuation should evaluate premedical history, physical examination, vital signs and\\nallergies. Routine investigations include a full blood count, liver, pancreas and renal\\nfunction tests, electrolytes (plus phosphate in patients on tenofovir-containing\\n regimens) as well as fasting cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose levels. Remarkably,\\na urine dipstick can detect proteinuria in patients on TDF-containing treatment\\n regimens. While the routine clinical visit is recommended at least quarterly, more\\nfrequent visits maybe necessary when beginning or after switching an ART regimen.\\nIn contrast, patients on a stable and tolerable ART may be seen less frequently.\\nHowever, with the increased life expectancy of HIV+ patients, comorbidities are\\ncoming to the fore. \\nThe following chapter addresses some ART-specific side effects. Our aim is to give\\nadvice regarding the clinical routine. Therefore we structured this chapter according\\nto organ (dys)functions and symptoms. \\nGastrointestinal side effects\\nGastrointestinal (GI) problems are the most common side effects even if they have\\nbecome less frequent, as older NRTIs like AZT, ddI or d4T are no longer recommended\\n(Robinson 2008, Chubineh 2008). GI side may effects appear more frequently during\\nthe early stages of therapy. Typical symptoms include abdominal discomfort or pain,\\nappetite loss, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting or constipation. Diarrhea occurs\\n frequently with older PIs and rarely occurs with integrase inhibitors like raltegravir,\\nelvitegravir and dolutegravir (Lee 2012) but can be seen with 3TC too. \\nIn most cases, symptoms occur early on therapy. Patients should be informed that\\nthese side effects usually resolve after 1-6 weeks of treatment. If gastrointestinal side\\neffects appear for the first time after longer periods on ART, other causes such as\\n gastritis and infectious diarrhea need to be considered. Fructose or other intolerances\\nshould be addressed. However, if no other causes of diarrhea could be found, a switch\\nof ART may be considered.\\nNausea and vomiting\\nIf administration on an empty stomach leads to nausea and vomiting, most drugs\\ncan be taken with meals. Only the NNRTI efavirenz has to be administered on empty\\nstomach; small quantities of low-fat salty crackers may improve nausea. Ginger,\\n peppermint or chamomile teas or sweets may also be helpful, as well as more  frequent\\nbut smaller meals. Fatty foods and dairy products should be avoided, as well as coffee,\\nsmoking, alcohol, NSAIDs like acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, diclofenac and very\\nspicy foods.\\nWhenever possible, other causes of nausea should be excluded (e.g., by gastroscopy)\\nand switching ART may be discussed. Metoclopramide has been proven to be useful.\\n281'),\n",

Mild liver enzyme increase is a common side\\neffect and has been reported for other drugs, such as maraviroc, raltegravir, dolute-\\ngravir, elvitegravir, rilpivirine and others. Hypersensitivity reactions are correlated\\nwith NNRTI use, are not dose-dependant, occur mostly within the first 4–12 weeks\\nand symptoms resolve usually after stopping the drug (Joshi 2011). There are black\\nbox warnings for hypersensitivity for nevirapine and rilpivirine (Cohen 2011, Molina\\n2011), the NRTI abacavir as well as the CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc. Boosted PIs such\\nas atazanavir/r can lead to hepatotoxicity at any stage during the course of treatment.\\nCommon risk factors for hepatotoxicity are elevated liver enzymes before initiating\\ntreatment, chronic hepatitis B or C, concomitant hepatotoxic medication, PI therapy,\\nolder age, higher BMI, female gender, thrombocytopenia, high alcohol intake, high\\nviral load or renal dysfunction (Sulkowski 2002, Servoss 2006, Nunez 2010).\\nNNRTIs\\nLiver toxicity occurs more commonly on nevirapine than on other antiretroviral\\ndrugs. Clinically asymptomatic and symptomatic liver toxicity, including rapidly\\noccurring fatal liver failure have been observed (Bjornsson 2006). Serious and fatal\\nliver toxicity has been reported even during post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), but\\nnot after single-dose nevirapine (McKoy 2009). Symptomatic hepatotoxicity seems\\nto depend on different risk factors: Female gender, body mass index <18.5 (Sanne\\n2005) or chronic hepatitis C (Torti 2007) and higher CD4 T cells at treatment initi-\\nation. A retrospective analysis of the Boehringer Ingelheim database showed a higher\\nrisk for females with CD4 T cell counts >250 cells/µl and for males >400/µl. Although\\nthese findings have not been confirmed by other studies (Manfredi 2006, Peters\\n2010), the Indications and Usage section advises against starting nevirapine treatment\\nabove these CD4 T cell counts in treatment-naïve patients unless the benefits clearly\\noutweigh the risks (Mallolas 2006, De Lazarri 2008). \\nIn general, nevirapine should be avoided in patients with liver cirrhosis Child–Pugh\\nclass B or C (Nunez 2010). Liver toxicity occurs usually early during ART (within 18\\nweeks of starting) and may progress to liver failure despite laboratory monitoring. If\\nliver enzymes increase to >3.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) during\\n treatment, nevirapine should be stopped immediately. Readministration must be\\n discussed carefully and should, whenever possible, be avoided. \\nIn patients treated with efavirenz or rilpivirine, minor enzyme elevations are\\n generally safe and usually resolve so that a treatment change may not be necessary\\n(Gutierrez 2008, Kontorinis 2003, Cohen 2011, Molina 2011).\\nProtease inhibitors and INSTIs\\nAtazanavir (as well as indinavir) inhibit the hepatic enzyme UDP glucuronosyl-trans-\\nferase, inducing non-dangerous hyperbilirubinemia in up to 50% of patients (Torti\\n2009). UGT1A1*28 variant allele seems to be a predictor of severe hyperbilirubine-\\nmia (Turatti 2012). Atazanavir was safe in end-stage liver disease patients, hepatitis\\ncoinfected patients and those with liver fibrosis (Guaraldi 2009, Pineda 2008). While\\ndarunavir and atazanavir were not associated with increased liver morbiditiy, other\\nPIs such as tipranavir/r are associated with a higher risk of transaminase elevations\\n(Hicks 2006). \\nIn all cases of unknown liver enzyme increase, hepatitis diagnostics (including HAV ,\\nHBV , HCV , HEV), syphilis testing (EBV and CMV) and abdominal ultrasound is\\n recommended.

Rates of elevated liver enzymes in patients with elvitegravir were\\n comparable to those treated with efavirenz or boosted atazanavir (DeJesus 2012, Sax\\n2012). Dolutegravir-associated increase in liver enzymes was mostly seen during\\nimmune reconstitution and coinfection with viral hepatitis (Curtis, 2014). In any\\ncase, transaminase elevation due to INSTI leads only in a very rare number of cases\\nto discontinuation. \\nRenal problems\\nRenal complications are mostly seen with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or less\\nlikely with atazanavir (see HIV and Renal Function). Rilpivirine, cobicistat, and dolute-\\ngravir reduce the tubular secretion of creatinine by different mechanisms, inducing\\na decrease of estimated glomerular filtration rate. \\nCalculated eGFR results might decrease after beginning a new treatment and will\\nestablish a plateau quickly (Sax 2012, Curtis 2014). Clinicians should carefully\\nmonitor renal function in order to identify possible alterations suggestive of a true\\nrenal functional impairment.  Additional renal monitoring (urine dipstick, alpha-1-\\nmicroglobulin, cystatin C-GFR or the albumin/creatinine ratio) should be used for\\nrenal safety monitoring or screening of tubular injury.    \\nBesides renal problems, rhabdomyolysis is a rare but dangerous event. Rhabdo -\\nmyolysis has been reported during abacavir HSR (Fontaine 2005), statin and boosted\\nPI use as a consequence of CYP450 interactions and in rare cases after raltegravir\\nexposure (Dori 2010). Immediate action should be taken if patients complain about\\nmuscle pain and/or otherwise unexplained elevated creatine kinase levels, to avoid\\nmore severe kidney injury. \\nTenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) \\nIn ART-naïve patients tenofovir is associated with a greater decline in renal function\\nand a higher risk of proximal tubular dysfunction: 4.8% of patients on tenofovir had\\na more than 50% decline of GFR compared to 2.9% without tenofovir (Horberg 2010).\\nA meta-analysis of 17 studies confirmed an association with a statistically significant\\nloss of renal function with TDF, although the clinical magnitude of this effect was\\nmodest (Cooper 2010). Severe cases have been reported with acute renal failure, prox-\\nimal tubulopathy with Fanconi’s syndrome and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and\\nrarely hypophosphatemic osteomalacia (Rollot 2003, Saumoy 2004). Renal toxicity\\noccurs after some months, rarely at the beginning of therapy. Risk factors include\\nhigh TDF exposure due to pre-existing renal impairment, low body weight (Nishijima\\n2012) or coadministration of nephrotoxic drugs (Nelson 2007). \\nBoosted PIs can interact with the renal transport of organic anions, leading to\\n proximal tubular intracellular accumulation of tenofovir (Izzedine 2004+2007, Rollot\\n2003).

Extensive pretreatment with NRTIs might be a risk factor (Saumoy 2004).\\nHowever, even in patients without any predisposing factors, nephrotoxicity may\\noccur (Barrios 2004). \\nIn cases of renal dysfunction, especially in patients with low body weight, TDF should\\nbe avoided, or the dosing interval should be adjusted (see Drugs). In case of severe\\nrenal dysfunction (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) TDF should not be adminis-\\ntered. As normal creatinine levels may be misleading especially in subjects with low\\nbody weight, creatinine clearance needs to be measured before initiating TDF. Renal\\nfunction tests including urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPC), urine albumin/creati-\\nnine ratio (UPA), creatinine clearance, proteinuria, glycosuria, urine dipstick and\\nurine phosphate should be monitored closely. Another tool to analyze the renal\\n function is the measurement of cystatin C and cystatin C-eGFR, to measure the\\ndecreased renal function more accurately (Lucas 2014 Driver 2013).\\nThe majority of renal dysfunction in TDF patients is related to pre-existing renal\\n disorders (Brennan 2011). Therefore it is not recommended for use in patients with\\npreexisting renal insufficiency. It should also be avoided with concomitant or recent\\nuse of nephrotoxic agents such as aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet,\\n ganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2. Usually,  abnorm -\\nalities resolve upon discontinuation (Izzedine 2004, Roling 2006). \\nNeurological side effects\\nThe most important neurological side effects are peripheral polyneuropathy caused\\nby NRTIs and CNS side effects caused by efavirenz (for other problems see neuro-\\nlogical chapters). \\nPeripheral polyneuropathy\\nPeripheral polyneuropathy (PNP) is mainly caused by d-NRTIs (ddI, d4T) or AZT and\\nare much less frequent today. Because of their continued use in resource-limited\\nareas, we will review the symptoms and possibilities for palliation. PNP usually\\n presents with a distal symmetrical distribution and sensorimotor paralysis. Patients\\ncomplain of paresthesia and pain (“tingling”) in hands and feet and perioral\\n dysesthesia. The symptoms often begin gradually after several months of therapy.\\nHIV infection itself can lead to PNP, but the drug-induced form becomes apparent\\nmuch earlier and may develop within a shorter period of time. Patients must be\\ninformed that they should consult their treating physician as soon as possible if these\\ncomplaints develop. Additional risk factors for polyneuropathy, such as vitamin B12\\ndeficiency, alcohol abuse, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition or treatment with other\\nneurotoxic drugs, e.g., INH, should be addressed as well. \\nSymptoms frequently improve within the first two months following discontinua-\\ntion of the drugs responsible, but may initially increase in intensity and are not\\nalways fully reversible. Because treatment is difficult and because there is no specific\\ntherapy, it is important that PNP is recognized early by the doctor, resulting in a\\nrapid change of treatment. The causative agent needs to be stopped. \\nAn easy test in practice is to test vibration with a tuning fork. A 64 Hz tuning fork\\n(Rydel-Seiffer) is applied to the appropriate bony surface (e.g., distal hallux, medial\\nmalleolus or lateral malleolus) bilaterally.

It has been shown that\\nefavirenz changes the sleeping pattern (Moyle 2006). These side effects are observed\\nmainly during the first days and weeks of treatment. Discontinuation of therapy\\nbecomes necessary in approximately 3% of patients. There is an association between\\nhigh plasma levels of efavirenz and the occurrence of CNS symptoms (Marzolini\\n2001). If the CNS side effects persist for more than two to four weeks, an ART switch\\nshould be discussed. Otherwise, the dose can be divided into a 400 mg night dose\\nand a 200 mg morning dose. With this schedule, we have observed a relevant reduc-\\ntion in unpleasant CNS side effects in our center. \\nCNS side effects are possible with etravirine, rilpivirine or dolutegravir as well\\n(Madruga 2007, Cohen 2011, Molina 2011, Mackenzie 2013), but they are less inten-\\nsive and less frequent.

The rash is seen less frequently with efavirenz, etravirine and rilpivirine\\ntherapy, and only rarely must be discontinued (Carr 2001, Cohen 2011, Molina\\n2011). With etravirine, fatal cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported\\nas well as hypersensitivity reactions sometimes accompanied by hepatic failure\\n(Borrás-Blasco 2008). It should be immediately discontinued when signs and\\n symptoms of severe skin or hypersensitivity reactions develop. \\nNNRTI allergy is a reversible, systemic reaction and typically presents as erythema-\\ntous, maculopapular, pruritic and confluent rash, distributed mainly over the trunk\\nand arms. Fever may precede the rash. Further symptoms include myalgia (some-\\ntimes severe), fatigue and mucosal ulceration. The allergy usually begins in the second\\nor third week of treatment. Women are more often and more severely affected\\n(Bersoff-Matcha 2001). If symptoms occur later than 8 weeks after initiation of\\ntherapy, other causes should be suspected.

Following a severe allergic reaction, the drug respon-\\nsible for the reaction should never be given again. \\nAbacavir hypersensitivity\\nAbacavir might cause a hypersensitivity reaction (HSR). HSR can be life-threatening\\nand occurs in approximately 4–8% of Caucasian patients (Hughes 2008). A higher\\nrate is seen in patients on a once-daily regime, on first-line regimens, with a nevi-\\nrapine allergy and with acute HIV infection. In over 90% of cases, the HSR occurs\\nafter a median of 8 days and within the first 6 weeks. HSR is strongly associated with\\nthe presence of the HLA-B*57:01 allele, which has a prevalence of approximately 6%\\nin Caucasians, and a very low prevalence in black populations (Orkin 2010). The\\nprospective PREDICT study involving 1956 patients from 19 countries showed that\\nHLA-B*57:01 screening reduces the risk of hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir\\n(Mallal 2008).

Respiratory symptoms, such as dyspnea,\\ncough and sore throat are rare. Changes in the blood count, elevation of liver transam-\\ninases, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine and LDH may accompany the HSR. There is\\nusually no eosinophilia.

Osteopenia and osteomalacia may occur in combination. \\nHIV+ individuals have lower bone density than uninfected individuals (Loiseau-Peres\\n2002, Fessel 2011). In particular, the use of TDF is associated with bone demineral-\\nization (Stellbrink 2010, Haskelberg 2012, Negredo 2015). These (usually mild) effects\\nare also seen in patients taking TDF-containing PrEP (Mulligan 2015). Tenofovir can\\ninduce a Fanconi’s syndrome with tubular phosphate loss and consequently\\n osteomalacia, despite no sign of vitamin D deficiency (Wanner 2009). There is also\\nevidence that long-term use of PIs is associated with BMD loss (Duvivier 2009, Kinai\\n2014). Loss of BMD is associated with increased rates of bone fractures (Triant 2008),\\nmainly affecting spine, hip and wrists.\\nIn 2015, detailed recommendations for guidance on the screening, diagnosis, mon-\\nitoring and management of bone disease in HIV+ patients were published (Brown\\n2015). Risk of fragility fracture should be assessed primarily using the Fracture Risk\\nAssessment Tool (FRAX, http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/), without dual-energy X-ray\\nabsorptiometry (DEXA scan), in all HIV+ men aged 40-49 years and HIV+ pre-\\nmenopausal women aged \\n/H1135040 years.

It is a possible side effect of ART. Fortunately, modern regimens are\\nmuch less likely to lead to fat tissue abnormalities. The metabolic abnormalities may\\nharbor a significant risk of developing cardiovascular disease. In addition, several\\nstudies report a reduced quality of life in patients with body habitus changes leading\\nto a reduced treatment adherence. Despite the impact of lipodystrophy syndrome\\non HIV management, little is known about the pathogenesis, its prevention, diag-\\nnosis and treatment. Current data indicate a rather multifactorial pathogenesis where\\nHIV infection, ART, and patient-related factors are all major contributors. The lack\\nof a clear and easy definition reflects the clinical heterogeneity, limits a clear  diagnosis\\nand impairs the comparison of results among clinical studies. Therapeutic and pre-\\nvention strategies have so far been of only limited clinical success, where avoiding\\nthe use of thymidine analogues appears to be most effective in avoiding peripheral\\nfat loss. General recommendations include dietary changes and lifestyle modifica-\\ntions, ART modification (replacing PIs with NNRTIs or replacing d4T and AZT with\\nabacavir or tenofovir or switching to an NRTI-free regimen, e.g., INSTI/NNRTI, see\\nchapter on ART), and finally, the use of metabolically active drugs. \\nClinical manifestation\\nLipodystrophy was originally described as a condition characterized by regional or\\ngeneralized loss of subcutaneous fat. Non-HIV-associated forms, such as congenital\\nor familial partial lipodystrophy, have a very low prevalence. Generally, these forms\\nare associated with complex metabolic abnormalities and are difficult to treat. The\\nterm “lipodystrophy syndrome” was introduced to describe a complex medical con-\\ndition including an apparent abnormal fat redistribution and metabolic disturbances\\nin HIV+ patients receiving protease inhibitor therapy (Carr 1998). Now, years after\\nits first description, there is still no consensus on a case definition for lipodystrophy\\nsyndrome in HIV. Thus, the diagnosis of lipodystrophy in clinical practice often relies\\non a more individual interpretation than on an evaluated classification. Finally,\\nchanges in fat distribution have to be considered as being part of a rather dynamic\\nprocess. In most cases, peripheral lipoatrophy is clinically diagnosed when signifi-\\ncant fat loss of about 30% has already occurred.\\nHIV-associated lipodystrophy includes both clinical and metabolic alterations. The\\nmost prominent clinical sign is a loss of subcutaneous fat (lipoatrophy) in the face\\n(periorbital, temporal), limbs, and buttocks. Prospective studies in patients on thymi-\\ndine analogues have demonstrated an initial increase in limb fat during the first\\nmonths of therapy, followed by a progressive decline over the ensuing years (Mallon\\n2003), which is mostly persistent (Grunfeld 2010). Peripheral fat loss can be accom-\\npanied by an accumulation of visceral fat, which can cause mild gastrointestinal\\nsymptoms. Initially truncal fat increases on therapy and then remains stable (Mallon\\n2003). Visceral obesity, as a singular feature of abnormal fat redistribution, appears\\nto occur in only a minority of patients. Fat accumulation may also be found as dor-\\nsocervical fat pads (buffalo hump) or within the muscle and the liver. Female HIV+\\npatients sometimes complain about painful breast enlargement, attributed to the\\nlipodystrophy syndrome. Whether gynecomastia in male patients is a component\\nof the syndrome remains unclear. There is now accumulating evidence that the major\\nclinical components – lipoatrophy, central adiposity and the combination of both\\n– result from different pathogenetic developmental processes.     \\nThe risk of the syndrome increases with the duration of treatment, the age of the\\nManagement of Side Effects    291'),\n",

Children can be affected, like adults,\\nwith clinical fat redistribution shortly after initiation or change of ART. The  evolution\\nof the individual clinical components of the lipodystrophy syndrome is variable.\\nThe nucleoside analogue linked most strongly to lipoatrophy is d4T, particularly\\nwhen used in combination with ddI. Tenofovir combined with 3TC and efavirenz is\\nassociated with less loss of limb fat than d4T in a similar combination in therapy-\\nnaïve HIV+ patients (Gallant 2004).\\nHyperlipidemia is a frequent side effect of antiretroviral therapies, especially those\\nthat include PIs (Nduka 2015). Newer drugs such as dolutegravir, elvitegravir, ralte-\\ngravir, maraviroc, second-generation NNRTIs such as rilpivirine do not disadvan-\\ntages in lipid metabolism and may therefore offer a favorable safety profile in patients\\nat risk (Curtis 2014, Quercia 2015). \\nAs many HIV+ patients present with already decreased HDL levels, these are not\\nfurther reduced by antiretroviral drugs, but usually improve, particularly when nevi-\\nrapine or rilpivirine is used (Pinnetti 2014). Hypertriglyceridemia, especially in\\npatients with evidence of body fat abnormalities, is the leading lipid abnormality\\nalone or in combination with hypercholesterolemia. Several weeks after initiation\\nor change of HIV therapy, lipid levels usually reach a plateau and remain stable. Part\\nof this increase can be considered as reconstitution of health, as some patients return\\nto the lipid levels they had before seroconversion. All PIs can potentially lead to\\nhyperlipidemia, although to different extents. For example, atazanavir and darunavir\\nappear to be less frequently associated with dyslipidemia and insulin resistance\\n(Aberg 2012). In contrast, ritonavir often leads to hypertriglyceridemia correlating\\nto the drug levels. Boosted lopinavir leads to an approximate 18% mean increase in\\ntotal cholesterol and 40% mean increase in triglycerides in patients on first-line\\ntherapy (Randell 2010).\\nDiagnosis\\nBoth the lack of a formal definition and uncertainty about the pathogenesis and pos-\\nsible long-term consequences leads to a continuing discussion about appropriate\\nguidelines for the assessment and management of HIV lipodystrophy syndrome and\\nits metabolic abnormalities. Outside clinical studies, the diagnosis relies principally\\non the occurrence of apparent clinical signs and the patient reporting them. A\\n standardized data collection form may assist in diagnosis (Grinspoon 2005). This\\nappears sufficient for routine clinical assessment, especially when the body habitus\\nchanges develop rapidly and severely. For clinical investigations however, especially\\nin  epidemiological and intervention studies, more reliable measurements are\\nrequired. A multicenter study to develop an objective and broadly applicable case\\ndefinition proposes a model including age, sex, duration of HIV infection, HIV disease\\nstage, waist-to-hip ratio, anion gap, serum HDL cholesterol, trunk-to-peripheral-fat\\nratio, percentage leg fat, and intra-abdominal to extra-abdominal fat ratio. Using\\nthese parameters, the diagnosis of lipodystrophy had a 79% sensitivity and 80%\\nspecificity (Carr 2003). \\nDespite individual limitations, several techniques are suitable for measuring regional\\nfat distribution. These include dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), computer\\ntomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and sonography.\\nAnthropometric measurements are safe, portable, cheap and much easier to perform\\nthan imaging techniques. Waist circumference or sagittal diameter is more sensitive\\nand specific than waist-to-hip ratio. Repeated measurements of skinfold thickness\\ncan be useful for individual long-term monitoring but needs to be performed by an\\nexperienced person. \\n292 ART'),\n",

Consequently, CT and MRI should only be considered in\\nroutine clinical practice for selected patients (e.g., extended dorsocervical fat pads,\\ndifferential diagnosis of non-benign processes and infections). \\nDEXA is appropriate for examining appendicular fat, comprised almost entirely of\\nSAT, and has been successfully employed in epidemiological studies. However, SAT\\nand VAT cannot be distinguished by DEXA, limiting the evaluation of changes in\\ntruncal fat. Application of sonography to measure specific adipose compartments,\\nincluding those in the face, requires experienced investigators and has been mini-\\nmally applied in HIV infection so far. Bioelectrical impedance analysis estimates the\\nwhole body composition and cannot be recommended for measurement of abnor-\\nmal fat distribution.\\nPatients should routinely be questioned and examined for cardiovascular risk factors\\nsuch as smoking, hypertension, adiposity, type 2 diabetes, and family history. For\\nan accurate assessment of blood lipid levels, it is recommended to obtain blood after\\nfasting for at least 8 hours. Total cholesterol and triglycerides together with LDL and\\nHDL cholesterol should be obtained prior to the initiation of, or switch to, any new\\nantiretroviral therapy and repeated 3 to 6 months later. Fasting glucose should be\\nassessed with at least a similar frequency. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is\\na reliable and accurate instrument for evaluating insulin resistance and glucose intol-\\nerance. An OGTT may be indicated in patients with suspected insulin resistance such\\nas those with obesity (BMI >27 kg/m\\n2), a history of gestational diabetes and a fasting\\nglucose level of 110 to 126 mg/dl (impaired fasting glucose). The diagnosis of  diabetes\\nis based on fasting glucose levels >126 mg/dl, glucose levels of >200 mg/dl inde-\\npendent of fasting status, or a 2-hour OGTT glucose level above 200 mg/dl. Screening\\nof HbA1c appears to be less reliable, as in seronegative patients (Kim 2009, Eckhardt\\n2011). Additional factors that could lead to or assist in the development of hyper-\\nlipidemia and/or insulin resistance always need to be considered (e.g., alcohol con-\\nsumption, thyroid dysfunction, liver and kidney disease, hypogonadism, concurrent\\nmedication such as steroids, -receptor blockers, thiazides, etc).\\nTherapy\\nSo far, most attempts to improve or reverse abnormal fat distribution by modifica-\\ntion of ART have shown limited clinical success  (see ART subchapter When to switch\\nART). In particular, peripheral fat loss appears to be resistant to most therapeutic\\ninterventions. The metabolic components of the syndrome may be easier to improve\\n(Table 1). Thus, preventing lipoatrophy by avoiding thymidine analogs (AZT, d4T)\\nis the main goal (Behrens 2008). For more detailed recommendations for improving\\nfat redistribution and treating dyslipidemia, please see the guidelines of the European\\nAIDS Clinical Society (www.europeanaidsclinicalsociety.org).

The clinical benefit, however,\\nof lipid lowering or insulin-sensitizing therapy in HIV+ patients with lipodystrophy\\nremains to be demonstrated. In light of the potentially increased cardiovascular risk\\nto recipients of antiretroviral therapy, the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) pub-\\nlished recommendations based on the National Cholesterol Education Program\\n(NCEP) for primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease in seroneg-\\native patients. In addition, more detailed recommendations by the European AIDS\\nClinical Society have been published to provide guidelines for physicians actively\\ninvolved in HIV care that will be regularly updated (www.europeanaidsclinicalsoci-\\nety.org). However, these recommendations should be considered as being rather pre-\\nliminary, given the limited numbers, size and duration so far of the clinical studies\\nthey are based on. It appears reasonable to measure fasting lipid levels annually\\nbefore and 3-6 months after ART is initiated or changed. Whenever possible, the ART\\nleast likely to worsen lipid levels should be selected for patients with dyslipidemia.\\nMetformin has been evaluated for the treatment of lipodystrophy syndrome. Some\\nstudies have revealed a positive effect on the parameters of insulin resistance and\\nthe potential reduction of intra-abdominal (and subcutaneous) fat, although not\\nclinically significant. Together with exercise training, metformin has been described\\nto reverse the muscular adiposity in HIV+ patients (Driscoll 2004).

HIV Resistance and Viral Tropism Testing\\nPATRICK BRAUN AND EVA WOLF \\nThe goal of antiretroviral therapy is to achieve maximal suppression of viral repli-\\ncation. Viral blips while on suppressive ART are relatively common and mostly due\\nto random biological and statistical fluctuations (see 6.11, Monitoring of ART ).\\nHowever, patients with repeated episodes of detectable viremia – suggesting ongoing\\nviral replication rather than viral release from latent reservoirs secondary to immune\\nactivation – are at increased risk for the development of drug resistance. The level\\nof viral load on ART is the best predictor of subsequent virological failure; the risk\\nfor failure starts to increase at levels between 100 and 300 copies/ml (Nettles 2005,\\nDelaguerre 2009, Garcia-Gasco 2008) and is highest for any drug class at 1000 to\\n10,000 copies/ml (Prosperi 2011).\\nThe rapid development of resistant variants is due to the high turnover of HIV – in\\nan untreated patient approximately 10 million new viral particles are produced every\\nday (Perelson 1996) – and the exceptionally high error rate of HIV reverse\\n transcriptase. The latter leads to a high mutation rate and constant production of\\nnew viral strains, even in the absence of treatment. In the presence of antiretroviral\\ndrugs, the development of HIV-1 resistance depends on the selection of resistance-\\nassociated mutations (RAMs). If a virus has acquired one or more RAMs leading to\\nreduced drug sensitivity, the mutant virus attains a replication advantage in\\n comparison to wild-type virus when exposed to drugs (Drake 1993). The develop-\\nment of resistant viral strains is one of the main reasons for virological failure of\\nantiretroviral therapy. However, with the strategic use of the newer drug classes,\\neffective regimens are available even in salvage situations.\\nThe discussion about genotypic resistance and viral tropism in this chapter focuses\\non the methods of resistance and tropism testing, on mutation patterns emerging\\nwith ART use, their interpretations and clinical relevance. Most data are derived from\\npatients with subtype B viruses, representing the main subtype in North America,\\nAustralia and Europe, but only approximately 10% of the global HIV-1 population.\\nNon-B subtypes have increasingly been investigated, some exhibiting different resist-\\nance pathways and patterns (Snoeck 2006).\\nAssays for resistance testing\\nThere are two established assays for measuring resistance or sensitivity of HIV to\\n specific antiretroviral drugs – the genotypic and the phenotypic resistance tests\\n(Wilson 2003). Genotypic resistance measurements should be distinguished between\\nconventional (population-based) and ultrasensitive sequencing methods. \\nThe conventional genotypic assay accredited by the FDA is:\\n\\x81 ViroSeq\\n® (Abbott Molecular/Applera Corp. of Applied Biosystems and Celera). \\nConventional (population-based) genotypic tests can only detect viral mutants when\\nthese comprise at least 15-20% of the total virus population. Patients with a low or\\nnon-detectable viral load may benefit from sequencing proviral DNA. Concordance\\nof resistance data derived from viral RNA or proviral DNA sequencing is >80% (Boukli\\n2015, Ferrè 2015). The gold standard for resistance testing in viremic patients,\\nhowever, continues to use HIV RNA of free virions in EDTA plasma, since resistant\\nviruses may not necessarily be detectable in proviral DNA (Boukli 2015, De La Cruz\\n2015). Additionally, a large proportion of viruses from proviral DNA is unable to\\nreplicate (Ferre 2015). \\n300'),\n",

If the IC50 is below the biological cut-off,\\nvirological success is very likely. However, an IC 50 above the biological cut-off does\\nnot allow prediction of the virologic response to a drug. \\nIn contrast, the clinical cut-off indicates up to what levels of IC 50 virologic effective-\\nness can still be expected. Complete resistance to a drug (i.e., to protease inhibitors)\\ngenerally evolves gradually with the acquisition of several amino acid changes. In\\ngeneral, lower and upper clinical cut-offs are defined. The lower clinical cut-off is\\nthe fold-change in IC\\n50 (FC) which indicates slightly reduced virological response.\\nAn FC above the upper clinical cut-off indicates resistance, and an FC between the\\ntwo cut-offs indicates partial resistance. Due to limited clinical experience, cut-off\\ndata is often lacking for recently approved drugs. In these cases, interpretations are\\nbased on biological cut-offs.\\nIn the phenotypic analysis, mutations that do not confer resistance by themselves\\nbut provide evidence for transmitted, emerging or reverting resistance have no\\n influence on the measure of resistance. \\nBasic principles of genotyping\\nThe HIV genome consists of two RNA (ribonucleic acid) strands containing the\\ngenetic information of the virus. Within the nucleotide sequence of the HIV genome,\\na group of three nucleotides, called a codon, code for a particular amino acid in the\\nprotein sequence. Resistance mutations are described using a number for each gene,\\nshowing the position of the relevant codon, and two letters, the letter preceding the\\nnumber corresponding to the amino acid specified by the codon at this position in\\nthe wild-type virus, while the letter after the number describes the amino acid that\\nis produced from the mutated codon. \\nA change in the nucleotide sequence of a codon is called a mutation. ‘Silent’ muta-\\ntions code for the same amino acid. ‘Lethal’ mutations cause a defective protein\\nstructure leading to a stop of the viral replication cycle. Only those mutations that\\ncode for a different amino acid that leads to a change in the protein structure are\\nclinically relevant. This affects protein function and can contribute to the develop-\\nment of resistance to antiretroviral agents. M184V indicates a mutation in codon\\n184 of the reverse transcriptase gene leading to a valine for methionine substitution\\nin the reverse transcriptase enzyme and rendering the virus resistant to 3TC and FTC. \\nGenotypic assays are based on the analysis of mutations associated with resistance.\\nThese are determined by the direct sequencing of the amplified HIV genome or by\\nspecific hybridization techniques with wild-type or mutant oligonucleotides. For\\ntherapeutic decision making, sequencing of the pol region, which encodes for the\\nviral enzymes protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase, and sequencing of the\\nenv region, which encodes for the glycoproteins of the viral envelope, gp41 and\\n302 ART'),\n",

Other gene regions, in particular RNase H and gag, are\\nreported to be associated with phenotypic drug resistance. However, sequencing of\\nthese regions has only been performed in the context of research and is not part of\\nroutine diagnostics.\\nThe interpretation of genotypic resistance patterns is based on the correlation\\nbetween genotype, phenotype and clinical response. There is data available from in\\nvitro studies, clinical studies, clinical observations and duplicate testing, in which\\ngenotypically localized mutations have been investigated for phenotypic resistance.\\nTable 2: Pros and cons of genotypic resistance analysis (population-based sequencing)\\nGenotypic resistance analysis\\nAdvantages Disadvantages\\n• Quick analysis (results within days) • Indirect measurement of resistance\\n• Widely used (no specific safety requirements • Detection of viral mutants only possible when\\nfor laboratory) comprising ≥20 of the total virus population\\n• Listing of all changes in the nucleotide sequence • C omplex resistance patterns are often\\n• Detection of any mutation – with either evidence dif ficult to interpret\\nof resistance, emerging resistance or reverting • Unknown mutations are not considered for\\nresistance interpretation\\n• HIV-1 subtyping possible • Interpretation systems must be updated\\n• In general, reimbursement by health insurance regularly\\n(i.e., sequencing of the protease and the RT genes)\\nRules-based interpretation systems\\nFor the phenotypic interpretation of genotypic mutation patterns rules-based inter-\\npretation systems are commonly available.

The virtual phenotype is characterized by\\nphenotypic information derived from genotype without performing a phenotypic\\nresistance test in the laboratory. Phenotypic estimates derive from large databases of\\npaired genotypic and phenotypic information. \\nMethods of tropism testing \\nTo enter the target cell, HIV binds to the CD4 receptor and so-called chemokine co-\\nreceptors, of which CCR5 and CXCR4 are most important. Dependent on the use of\\ncoreceptors (“tropism”) the virus is classified as CCR5-(“R5”-) tropic or CXCR4-\\n(“X4”-) tropic. Viral strains using both coreceptors are called dual-tropic. Since\\ntropism tests cannot distinguish between dual-tropic viral isolates and a mixture of\\nR5- and X4-tropic viral isolates, the term dual/mixed (D/M) tropic is used.\\nAnalogous to resistance testing, tropism testing can be performed genotypically or\\nphenotypically (Braun 2007). European guidelines recommend both the enhanced\\nsensitivity Trofile assay and V3 loop population sequencing (Vandekerckhove 2011).\\nTable 4 outlines the advantages and disadvantages of both methods.\\nPhenotypic tropism testing\\nDue to its use in clinical trials, TrofileTM is the best-known phenotypic tropism test.\\nTrofileTM ES (TrofileTM with enhanced sensitivity) detects minor viral populations\\ndown to a 1% sensitivity. This test has further become available for the use of provi-\\nral DNA when viral load is <1000 HIV RNA copies/ml. Another commercially avail-\\nable phenotypic test is Phenoscript\\n® ENV (EuroFins/VIRalliance). An 85% agreement\\nbetween both assays has been reported (Skrabal 2007). Other non-commercial phe-\\nnotypic assays have been developed (Mulinge 2013).\\nGenotypic tropism testing\\nFor genotypic tropism analysis, the V3 domain of the gp120 gene – which is crucial\\nfor coreceptor binding and encodes for the viral tropism – is sequenced. This gene\\nsequence primarily defines the viral tropism, though other gp120 regions such as\\nV1/V2 and C4 as well as substitutions at gp41 also play a role. With viral loads\\nbetween 50 and 200 HIV RNA copies/ml, the preferred method is population-based\\nsequencing of the V3 loop from proviral DNA. Web-based bioinformatic tools are\\nused to predict viral tropism from the respective nucleotide sequence. These tools\\nuse methods like the charge rule, support vector machines or decision trees (Garrido\\n2008). The most popular tropism prediction tools geno2pheno [coreceptor] and\\nWebPSSM are available free of charge:  \\n\\x81 geno2pheno [coreceptor] http://coreceptor.geno2pheno.org/index.php\\n\\x81 WebPSSM http://indra.mullins.microbiol.washington.edu/webpssm/\\nGeno2pheno [coreceptor] is widely used and shows good concordance with Trofile\\nTM\\nES (Prosperi 2010, Sierra 2011, Kagan 2014).

The result of the geno2pheno [coreceptor] tool is the so-called false posi-\\ntive rate (FPR), which is the probability of classifying an R5 virus falsely as X4. A\\nfalse positive rate of 0.1% means that X4 tropism is very likely, whereas an FPR of\\n90% means that X4 tropism is very unlikely because an X4 prediction would be false\\nwith a 90% probability. \\n304 ART'),\n",

The European guidelines  recommend\\ntriplicate PCR amplification and sequencing (which is expensive and labor-inten-\\nsive). The corresponding FPR when using the geno2pheno [coreceptor] interpreta-\\ntion tool should be 10% to discriminate between R5- and X4-tropic virus.

In the meantime, Trofile ® ES has also become available for the testing of\\n proviral DNA. \\nMechanisms of resistance\\nNRTIs are prodrugs that only become effective after being intracellularly converted\\nto triphosphates. Nucleotide analogs require only two instead of three phosphory-\\nlation steps. Phosphorylated NRTIs compete with naturally occurring dNTPs\\n(deoxynucleotide triphosphates). The incorporation of a phosphorylated NRTI into\\nthe proviral DNA blocks elongation of the DNA, resulting in interruption of the\\nchain. There are two main biochemical mechanisms that lead to NRTI resistance (De\\nMendoza 2002): \\nSterical inhibition is caused by mutations enabling reverse transcriptase to recognize\\nstructural differences between NRTIs and dNTPs. Incorporation of NRTIs is then\\n prevented in favor of dNTPs, e.g., in the presence of mutations M184V , Q151M,\\nL74V , or K65R (Naeger 2001, Clavel 2004). \\nPhosphorolysis via ATP (adenosine triphosphate) or pyrophosphate leads to the\\n excision of the NRTIs already incorporated into the growing DNA chain. This is the\\ncase with M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y and K219Q (Meyer 2000). Phosphor -\\nolysis leads to cross-resistance between NRTIs, the degree of which may differ between\\nagents (AZT, d4T > ABC > ddI > 3TC). Contrary to the excision mutations, K65R leads\\nto a decreased excision of all NRTIs when compared to wild-type, resulting in a greater\\nstability once incorporated. For K65R, the combined effect of its opposing mecha-\\nnisms (decreased incorporation and decreased excision) results in a decreased\\n susceptibility to NRTIs but an increased susceptibility to AZT (White 2005).\\nNNRTIs also inhibit the reverse transcriptase. NNRTIs are small molecules that bind\\nto the hydrophobic pocket close to the catalytic domain of this enzyme. Mutations\\nat the NNRTI binding site reduce the affinity of the NNRTIs to the reverse tran-\\nscriptase, thus leading to a loss of antiviral activity. Whereas a single mutation can\\nconfer resistance to first generation NNRTIs, resistance patterns are more complex\\nfor second generation NNRTIs (Vingerhoets 2008, Molina 2008).  \\nPIs hinder the cleavage of viral precursor gag-pol-polyprotein by the HIV protease,\\nthereby producing immature, non-infectious viral particles.

They are selected early in\\nthe process of resistance and/or are located within the active site of the HIV pro-\\ntease. They reduce the ability of the protease inhibitor to bind to the enzyme. Major\\nor primary mutations may also lead to reduced activity of the protease . \\nMinor mutations (often referred to as secondary mutations ) are located outside the\\nactive site and usually occur after major mutations. Minor mutations are commonly\\nfound at polymorphic sites of non-B subtypes. Minor mutations compensate for the\\nreduction in viral fitness caused by major mutations (Nijhuis 1999, Johnson 2007b).\\nMutations at positions 20, 36, 63, and 77 are polymorphisms occurring without selec-\\ntive drug pressure particularly in non-B subtypes. Their contribution to resistance is\\nminor and depends on the presence of other mutations.\\nEntry inhibitors prevent HIV from entering target cells. The first step in cell entry\\noccurs when the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 binds to the CD4 receptor leading\\nto conformational changes in gp120 and enabling the binding of the V3 loop of\\ngp120 to the chemokine coreceptors, CCR5 or CXCR4, of the target cell. Interactions\\nbetween the two heptad repeat regions HR1 and HR2 within the trans-membrane\\nglycoprotein subunit gp41 lead to a conformational change in gp41 and enable fusion\\nof the viral and cellular membranes. CCR5 antagonists bind to the CCR5 corecep-\\ntor and thereby impede interaction with the viral surface protein gp120 necessary\\nfor entry into the target cell. The fusion inhibitor T-20, a synthetic peptide consist-\\ning of 36 amino acids, mimics the C-terminal HR2 domain of gp41 and competi-\\ntively binds to HR1. Thus, interactions between HR1 and HR2 are blocked and the\\nconformational change of gp41 that is necessary for fusion of virions to host cells is\\ninhibited. A single amino acid substitution in HR1 can reduce the efficacy of T-20.\\nIntegrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) prevent insertion of HIV DNA into\\nthe human DNA genome which is catalyzed by viral integrase. INSTIs such as ralte-\\ngravir, elvitegravir and dolutegravir block the strand transfer step. They bind to the\\ncatalytic pocket of the integrase and are transported as a component of the DNA/inte-\\ngrase pre-integration complex into the cell nucleus where strand transfer activity of\\nintegrase is inhibited. The selection of key mutations in the integrase gene confers\\nresistance to integrase inhibitors. Strand transfer as well as the preceding step of 3’\\nprocessing (cleavage of the terminal dinucleotides from both 3’ ends of viral cDNA\\nto which integrase binds) can be affected by these mutations. Different resistance\\npathways have been observed. The accumulation of additional mutations leads to a\\nfurther decrease in susceptibility (Fransen 2008, Miller 2008).  \\nTransmission of resistant HIV strains\\nThe prevalence of resistance mutations in treatment-naïve patients differs by demo-\\ngraphic region. A prevalence of more than 20% has been observed in large US cities\\nwith significant populations of MSM and a long history of access to antiretroviral\\ntreatment. Data on the incidence and prevalence of primary drug resistance pub-\\nlished before 2007 should be interpreted with caution, since a consensus definition\\nof transmitted genotypic drug resistance had not been established. In 2007 (update\\n2009), an international research group agreed upon criteria defining mutations\\nindicative for transmitted drug resistance (Bennett 2009). This standardization allows\\nfor comparisons of epidemiological data across geographic regions and periods of\\ntime.\\nIn a systemic review of 215 studies with a total of 43,170 patients until 2009 trans-\\nmission of resistance was most prevalent in North America (12.9%), followed by\\nEurope (10.9%), Latin America (6.3%), Africa (4.7%) and Asia (4.2%).

Changes with respect to  specific\\ndrug classes were generally seen over time. Resistance to NRTIs decreased signifi-\\ncantly over time in North America, Europe and Latin America, while NNRTI-resis-\\ntance increased (Frentz 2012).\\nIn the German Seroconverter Study, the prevalence of any resistance mutation was\\n12.1% between 1996 and 2012 (Bartmeyer 2010, Meixenberger 2011). Whereas the\\ntotal prevalence remained stable during the observation period, NRTI-resistant virus\\npopulations (mainly TAMs) decreased to 6.1% while there was a trend toward more\\nNNRTI resistance (2.4%, most frequently K103N/S). Dual- or triple-class resistance\\nwas rare with 1.2% and 0.3%, respectively. The most frequently reported PI muta-\\ntions were M46L and L90M (Kuecherer 2013). In chronically infected patients of the\\nGerman RESINA study, the proportion with primary resistance was 10.4% between\\n2001 and 2012 (Jensen 2013).\\nEuropean-wide data from the years 2006–2007 derive from SPREAD (Strategy to\\nControl Spread of HIV Drug Resistance), a program established to monitor primary\\nresistance in newly infected patients and ART-naïve patients. In total, at least one\\nresistance-associated mutation was found in 9.7% of newly diagnosed HIV+ patients.\\nNRTI, NNRTI and PI resistance was found in 5.1%, 3.7% and 2.3%, respectively. Two-\\nclass resistance was present in less than one percent (Hofstra 2013). Resistance muta-\\ntions were found in 16.7% of all newly diagnosed patients between 2008 and 2014\\nin the US (Saduvala 2014).\\nUltrasensitive methods such as allele-specific real-time PCR (AS PCR) or ultra-deep\\nsequencing detect resistance mutations more often than conventional sequencing\\nmethods. A study from Atlanta found minor resistance mutations in 34 of 205\\npatients (17%), in which only wild-type virus was identified using conventional\\nsequencing (Johnson 2008). In a British study investigating 165 samples from the\\nyears 2003–2006, drug resistance was detected in 13% of samples when using the\\nstandard assay compared to 19% when using an assay more sensitive for K103N,\\nY181C or M184V. In particular, the proportion of M184V isolates increased from\\n0.6% to 8%. The prevalence of drug resistance was almost similar for treatment naïve\\npatients with either primary or chronic HIV infection (19% and 20%) confirming\\ndata showing that primary resistance can persist for a long time (Buckton 2011, Pao\\n2004). In 2010, the transmission of a virus resistant to INSTIs was reported for the\\nfirst time. The virus also harbored NRTI, NNRTI and PI resistance mutations. The\\nauthors recommended sequencing the integrase gene in cases of transmitted mul-\\ntidrug resistance (Young 2010).\\nTable 6: Prevalence of resistance prior to initiation of therapy (a selection)  \\nAuthor Country or region Time period Patient population N Prevalence \\n(study)\\nKücherer 2013 Germany 1996–2012 Seroconverter 2,060 12.1%\\nHofstra 2013 Europe (SPREAD) 2008–2010 Newly diagnosed 2,398 9.2%\\nMonge 2014 Spain (CoRIS) 2007–2011 ART-naïve 2,781 7.9%\\nJensen 2013 Germany (RESINA) 2001–2012 Chronically infected 2,855 10.4%\\nMargot 2014 US/Western Europe 2000/2003 ART-naïve 2,516 NRTI/INI:\\nversus 2013 each <3%/0.1%\\nNNRTI: 1.9 versus \\n7.8%\\nSaduvala 2014 US 2008-2011 Newly diagnosed 16,894 16.7%\\n308 ART'),\n",

For ethical reasons,\\nstudies that prospectively examine the benefits of resistance analysis, especially in\\npre-treated patients for regimens including drug classes such as integrase inhibitors\\nor CCR5 antagonists, are no longer justifiable.\\nA resistance test before ART initiation is part of routine diagnosis in regions where\\nthe transmission of resistant HIV viruses is seen. The impact of transmitted HIV\\nresistance on the initial success of ART was investigated in a retrospective analysis\\nof the Eurocoord-CHAIN project. Of 10,458 patients initiated on ART in 1998, blood\\nsamples before therapy were retrospectively examined for resistance. The initial\\n regimens’ activities were essential for durable therapeutic success. Patients who were\\ntreated with only partially active regimens had a 2.6-fold higher risk of treatment\\nfailure (Wittkop 2011). \\nRelevance of minor variants\\nA meta-analysis of 10 studies and 985 patients found inferior efficacy of an NNRTI-\\nbased first-line therapy in the presence of minor resistant viral variants, especially if\\nthese conferred NNRTI resistance (Li 2011). Data from the Swiss cohort in therapy-\\nexperienced patients show a continual decline in the relative proportion of patients\\nwith resistance mutations over time. In 2003 one of three treatment-experienced\\npatients had resistant viruses; by 2013 this had decreased to one of four. The largest\\nproportion is seen in patients who had started mono- or dual therapy a long time\\nbefore (Scherrer 2015).\\nResistance testing before treatment initiation and at time of virological failure is an\\nintegral part of management and treatment of HIV infection.\\nInterpretation of genotypic resistance profiles\\nThe algorithms cited below are only indicative. Treatment decisions should not be\\nmade based on these data alone. We recommend the use of a resistance interpreta-\\ntion system listed in Table 3. \\nNRTIs\\nFTC has nearly the same resistance pattern as 3TC: resistance is associated with the\\nmutation M184V (Borroto-Esoda 2007). M184V also reduces viral replication capac-\\nity (often referred to as reduced viral fitness) by 40-60% (Deval 2004). After 52 weeks\\nwith 3TC monotherapy, the viral load remained 0.5 log below the initial levels despite\\nearly development of the M184V mutation (Eron 1995). When compared to treat-\\nment interruptions, monotherapy with 3TC delays virological and immunological\\ndeterioration (Castagna 2006). M184I is often detected before and then replaced by\\nM184V (Schuurmann 1995). M184V occurs more commonly on 3TC than on FTC,\\nespecially in combination with TDF (Svicher 2010). \\nT69I is a rare mutation which causes high-level resistance to 3TC, FTC and possibly\\nalso to TDF (Svicher 2010).\\nThymidine analog mutations, known as TAMs, were first observed with AZT and d4T\\n(Larder 1989, Loveday 1999). They include the mutations M41L, D67N, K70R,\\nL210W, T215Y and K219Q. The combination of certain TAMs also impact the effi-\\ncacy of ABC, ddI and TDF (Table 8).

Y115F is a specific ABC-associated resistance\\nmutation, which also affects the susceptibility to TDF. V75T, which is associated with\\nan approximately 5-fold increase in resistance to d4T and ddI, is only rarely observed\\n(Lacey 1994).\\nTDF primarily selects for the K65R mutation and leads to an (intermediate) resist-\\nance to TDF, ABC, ddI, 3TC, FTC, and possibly d4T (Miller 2004, Garcia-Lerma 2003).\\nAlthough K65R may emerge on ABC, K65R was rarely seen before the introduction\\nof TDF. This can be explained by the observation that combination therapies con-\\ntaining AZT lead to a lower incidence of the K65R mutation. Prior to TDF, ABC was\\nmainly used as part of the fixed-dose combination Trizivir\\n®. K65R seldom emerges\\nin the presence of TAMs. Since K65R and TAMs represent two antagonistic resistance\\npathways (see Mechanisms of resistance), K65R is rarely observed on the same genome\\nwith TAMs and almost never with L74V (Wirden 2005). However, virological failure\\nof other triple-nuke combinations such as TDF+3TC plus ABC or ddI was often\\n associated with the development of the K65R (Landman 2003). The main reason for\\nthe high failure rate seems to be the low genetic barrier of these regimens: the emer-\\ngence of the K65R induces a loss of sensitivity to all three drugs. K65R increases\\n sensitivity to AZT and induces a resensitization in the presence of (few) TAMs (White\\n2005). On the other hand, TAMs reduce the K65R-associated resistance to TDF, ABC\\nand ddI (Parikh 2007). \\nAs with M184V , K65R reduces the viral replication capacity (RC), which is not the\\ncase with TAMs or the L74V/I. The presence of both mutations K65R and M184V\\nled to an RC of only 29% (White 2002, Deval 2004). \\nLess frequently than K65R, the mutations K70E or K70G were observed on failing\\ntherapy with TDF, particularly in NRTI-based regimens with ABC and 3TC (Delaugerre\\n2008). M70E and K65R may be observed simultaneously, but it unusual that these\\nmutations emerge on the same genome (Lloyd 2005). There is one case report of the\\ndevelopment of K70E and M184V during therapy with TDF and FTC, which were\\nthen replaced by K70G and M184V. Both mutations were located on the same genome\\nand conferred phenotypic resistance to all NRTIs except for AZT or d4T (Bradshaw 2007).\\nM184V as well as the L74V mutation and the NNRTI-specific mutations, L100I and\\nY181C, may have an antagonistic effect on the further development of resistance\\n(Vandamme 1999, Underwood 2005). \\nM184V induces resensitization to AZT and d4T, resulting in a reduction of IC\\n50 by\\n50 and 30%, respectively. L74V/I with or without M184V leads to a reduction in IC50\\nof about 70%. However, resensitization is of clinical relevance only if there are no\\nmore than three other AZT- or d4T-associated mutations (Underwood 2005). The\\nM184V mutation also increases sensitivity to TDF (Miller 2001, Miller 2004). In\\n contrast, the presence of M184V plus multiple NAMs or mutations at positions 65,\\n74 or 115 increase resistance to ABC (Harrigan 2000). \\nSo-called multidrug resistance (MDR) to all NRTIs – except 3TC and probably FTC,\\nis established with T69SSX, i.e., the T69S mutation plus an insertion of 2 amino\\nacids (SS, SG or SA) between positions 69 and 70 (Masquelier 2001). The T69SSX\\ninsertion induces an approximately 20-fold increase in resistance to TDF (Miller\\n2001+2004). The MDR mutation Q151M is relatively uncommon. Q151M alone leads\\nto intermediate resistance to AZT, d4T, ddI and ABC and involves only a minor loss\\nof TDF activity. Q151M combined with mutations at positions 75, 77 and 116 confers\\nhigh-grade resistance to AZT, ddI, d4T and ABC and intermediate resistance to TDF.\\nThe insertion T69SSX together with the mutation M184V , as well as the mutation\\nQ151M together with M184V , leads to a 70% reduction in viral replication capacity\\n(Miller 2003, White 2004).

In vitro data suggest that by reaching 5-fold higher intracellular levels of\\nthe active substance, the use of TAF may overcome NRTI-resistant viruses (Margot\\n2013). We are still waiting on clinical data. \\nIn large patient cohorts, quantitative measurements of sensitivity have shown that\\nup to 29% of NRTI-experienced patients have a hypersusceptibility to NNRTIs (i.e.,\\na reduction in the inhibitory concentration by a factor of 0.3–0.6). A reduction in\\nAZT or 3TC sensitivity correlates inversely with an increased NNRTI susceptibility\\n(Shulman 2000). The reverse transcriptase mutations T215Y, H208Y and V118Iseem\\npredictive for efavirenz hypersusceptibility. This is also true for non-thymidine\\nanalog-associated NAMs like K65R, T69X, M184V and in particular for the combi-\\nnation K65R+M184V (Whitcomb 2000, Shulman 2004, Coakley 2005a). However,\\nthese results have not influenced treatment strategies.\\nNNRTIs\\nFirst generation NNRTIs  \\nSeveral mutations have been described with first-generation NNRTIs such as efavirenz\\nand nevirapine. They are listed in Table 9.

Contrary to V106A, V106M is seen more\\nfrequently with subtype C as with subtype B viruses  (Grossmann 2004). Nevirapine\\nor efavirenz should be stopped in the presence of mutations as the selection of further\\nRAMs may compromise the efficacy of second generation NNRTIs.\\nSecond generation NNRTIs\\nEtravirine is effective against variants with single NNRTI mutations like K103N,\\nY188L and/or G190A (Andries 2004, Vingerhoets 2010). Compared to earlier NNRTIs,\\netravirine has a higher genetic barrier, probably due to flexible binding to the reverse\\ntranscriptase site. In a selection experiment, the dominant viral population harbo-\\nred, after several in vitro passages, the mutations V179F (a new variant at this posi-\\ntion) and Y181C. Other mutations that have been selected in vitro are L100I, E138K,\\nY188H, G190E, M230L, and V179I (Brilliant 2004, Vingerhoets 2005). Similarly,\\nV179F, V179I and Y181C were seen with virologic failure in the DUET studies. Further\\nRAMs were noted at positions 101 and 138  (Tambuyzer 2010). Using a regression\\nmodel and a data set of 519 geno-/phenotype pairs, 5 key mutations at 4 positions\\ncould be identified: K101P, Y181I/V , G190E and F227C. In addition, K101H, E138G,\\nV179F and M230L proved to be relevant (Melikian 2014). \\nIn the DUET studies, 17 RAMs for etravirine were identified: V90I, A98G, L100I,\\nK101E/H/P, V106I, E138A, V179D/F/T, Y181C/I/V , G190A/S and M230L. Based on\\nthese, an etravirine resistance score was developed. A weighting factor of 3 was attrib-\\nuted to Y181I/V , followed by a weighting factor of 2.5 for L100I, K101P, Y181C, and\\nM230L. The mutations E138A, V106I, G190S, and V179F received a weighting factor\\nof 1.5 and the other mutations were weighted with 1.

In 46%, 31% and 23% of resistant isolates respectively, 1, 2 or \\n3 NNRTI mutations were detected. \\nOverall, 15 RAMs were identified as being associated with a decreased susceptibility\\nto rilpivirine: K101E/P, E138A/G/K/Q/R, V179L, Y181C/I/V , H221Y, F227C, M230I/L.\\nThese RAMs were identified either (a) in vitro as HIV-1 SDMs conferring phenotypic\\nresistance to rilpivirine (K101P, Y181I, and Y181V with fold-changes in IC\\n50 of 51.7,\\n15.3, and 12.2, respectively); (b) at the time of virological failure in ECHO and THRIVE\\n(K101E, E138K/G, Y181C, H221Y, V179L, F227C, and M230I/L);  (c) in in vitro selec-\\ntion experiments in strains with decreased susceptibility to rilpivirine (E138R and\\nE138Q); and (d) in clinical isolates with an increased fold-change to rilpivirine\\n(E138A). Cross-resistance to etravirine was commonly observed among patients\\nfailing rilpivirine (>90%) (Rimsky 2012). Besides NNRTI mutations, NRTI mutations\\nwere also more frequent among treatment failures on rilpivirine (68% versus 32%)\\n– with primarily M184I on rilpivirine and M184V on efavirenz. \\nProtease Inhibitors (PIs)\\nBoosted PIs are a drug class with a high genetic barrier. Generally, several RAMs are\\nrequired for complete loss in efficacy. The spectrum of PI RAMs is broad. As seen\\nwith numerous other antiviral agents, continuation of a failing PI regimen leads to\\nthe development of further mutations, which ultimately results in moderate to high\\ncross-resistance between PIs. If treatment is changed early on to another PI combi-\\nnation, i.e., before the accumulation of multiple mutations, the subsequent regimen\\nmay be successful. In first-line therapy with ritonavir-boosted PIs the emergence of\\nmajor PI mutations is rare and has been observed infrequently (Conradie 2004, Friend\\n2004, Coakley 2005b, Lataillade 2008). \\nFirst generation PIs \\nLopinavir/r: A few cases report an emerging lopinavir resistance associated with the\\noccurrence of the V82A followed by the mutations V32I, M46M/I and I47A, leading\\n312 ART'),\n",

On failing monotherapy three viral isolates har-\\nbored L76V (Delaugerre 2007).\\nLopinavir failure is primarily associated with mutations at the positions 46, 54 and\\n82, but also with the mutations I50V or V32I in combination with I47A/V/I. (Kempf\\n2001, Parkin 2003, Kagan 2005, Mo 2005).The mutation I47A, which has rarely been\\nobserved since the availability of lopinavir, reduces the binding affinity to lopinavir\\nand results in an 86- to >110-fold loss of sensitivity. In contrast, I47A leads to\\nsaquinavir hypersusceptibility due to an enhanced binding affinity to saquinavir\\n(Kagan 2005).\\nThe mutation L76V , selected for by lopinavir (Delaugerre 2009), (fos-)amprenavir or\\ndarunavir, can lead to resensitization to atazanavir, saquinavir and tipranavir\\n(Mueller 2004, De Meyer 2008). It has been demonstrated that viruses with the muta-\\ntion L76V could be successfully controlled by the simultaneous use of two PIs, for\\nexample lopinavir (to maintain L76V) and saquinavir (resensitized) despite addi-\\ntional protease mutations (Wiesmann 2011). \\nAtazanavir is an azapeptidomimetic PI. The resistance profile differs in part from\\nthat of other PIs. In patients in whom first-line treatment with unboosted atazanavir\\nfailed, the mutation I50L – often combined with A71V , K45R, and/or G73S – was pri-\\nmarily observed (Colonno 2004a+b). I50L leads to an increased susceptibility to other\\nfirst-generation PIs. Mutants harboring I50L plus A71V showed a 2- to 9-fold\\nincreased binding affinity to the HIV protease (Weinheimer 2005). In PI-experienced\\npatients, the I50L mutation was selected for in only one third of patients failing\\natazanavir (Colonno 2004a/2004b). The accumulation of PI mutations such as\\nL10I/V/F, K20R/M/I, L24I, L33I/F/V , M36I/L/V , M46I/L, M48V , I54V/L, L63P,\\nA71V/T/I, G73C/S/T/A, V82A/F/S/T, L90M, and in particular, I84V , leads to a loss of\\nsensitivity to atazanavir.  As with other PIs, the resistance barrier is higher when\\natazanavir is boosted (Colonno 2004).\\nIn the CASTLE study using atazanavir/r in ART-naïve patients, only two patients\\ndeveloped resistance to atazanavir (M46M/I+N88N/S and V32I+M46I+L90M)\\n(Lataillade 2008). The Reyaphar score can predict response to ritonavir-boosted\\natazanavir in pre-treated patients, including mutations at 12 positions (L10I/F/R/V ,\\nK20I/M/R, L241, M461/L, 154L/M/T/V , Q58E, L63P, A71I/L/V/T, G73A/C/F/T, V771,\\nV82A/F/S/T, 184V and L90M). With less than 5 Reyaphar mutations, the average viral\\nload reduction at 12 weeks was 1.4 logs, compared to only 0.5 log with more than\\n5 mutations (Pellegrin 2006). \\nSaquinavir: several RAMs including I84V/A are required to impact efficacy (Valer\\n2002). In a retrospective study, the presence of 3-4 mutations out of L10F/I/M/R/V ,\\nI15A/V , K20I/M/R/T, L24I, I62V , G73ST, 82A/F/S/T, I84V , and L90M was identified as\\nbeing most strongly associated with reduced response (Marcelin 2007a). In contrast,\\nL76V (observed on failing lopinavir or fosamprenavir) can lead to a clinically rele-\\nvant resensitization for saquinavir (Wiesmann 2011).\\nFosamprenavir: In patients with virologic failure on amprenavir, the following\\nmutations have been selected: I54L/M, I50V or V32I plus I47V , often together with\\nthe mutation M46I (Maguire 2002). The Zephir study evaluated virological response\\nto treatment with fosamprenavir/r in 121 treatment-experienced patients. With less\\nthan three mutations of L10I/F/R/V , L33F, M36I, M46I/L, I54L/M/T/V , I62V , L63P,\\nA71I/L/V/T, G73A/C/F/T, V82A/F/S/T, I84V and L90M, viral load was reduced by 2.4\\nlog 12 weeks after treatment initiation compared to only -0.1 log with 4 or more\\nmutations. In a retrospective study in 73 patients, N88S/D was associated with an\\nincreased response (Masquelier 2008).

In vitro, resistance to darunavir develops more slowly\\nthan seen with nelfinavir, amprenavir or lopinavir (De Meyer 2005). \\nEleven mutations at 10 positions were associated with a diminished response to\\ndarunavir/r, as long as at least three of these developed: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V ,\\nI50V/L, I54L/M, T74P, L76V , I84V and L89V (Johnson 2013). Individual mutations\\nappear to influence susceptibility to darunavir in varying degrees. I50V has the\\nhighest impact, followed by I54M, L76V and I84V; V32I, and L33F, and I47V have\\nless influence. The weakest impact was associated with V11I, I54L, G73S and L89V.\\nThis weighting, especially of I54L, needs to be validated.\\nNew mutations that have occurred on treatment failure with darunavir are V32I,\\nL33F, I47V , I54L, and L89V. Approximately 50% of these isolates were sensitive to\\ntipranavir. Conversely, over 50% of isolates with reduced tipranavir susceptibility\\nwere still sensitive to darunavir (De Meyer 2006). Based on an analysis of the POWER\\nand DUET data, the mutation V82A and E35D are positively associated with response\\nto darunavir (De Meyer 2009, Descamps 2009).\\nA database analysis of 50,000 paired genotypes and phenotypes showed that between\\n2006 and 2009 darunavir-associated mutations increased:  I50V (from 11 to 15%),\\nI54L (from 17 to 33%) and L76V (from 5 to 9%) (Stawiski 2010).\\nTipranavir shows good efficacy against viruses with multiple PI mutations. In vitro,\\nL33F and I84V are the first mutations selected by tipranavir, but the loss in sensi-\\ntivity is only two-fold (Doyon 2005). From data of Phase III trials, an “unweighted”\\ntipranavir mutation score was initially developed, comprising of 21 protease muta-\\ntions at 16 positions (Baxter 2006). This score was followed by a “weighted” tipranavir\\nscore based on clinical data of the RESIST trials (Scherer 2007). The respective model\\nincludes mutations of the unweighted score plus five mutations which were related\\nto an increased tipranavir susceptibility (24I, 30N, 50L/V , 54L, 76V). Weight factors\\nwere assigned to the mutations according to their contribution to resistance. The\\nweights of the mutations add up to the weighted tipranavir score. The major muta-\\ntions I47V , I54A/M/V , Q58E, T74P, V82L/T, and N83D contribute significantly to\\ntipranavir resistance.\\nIntegrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs)\\nSequence analysis of viruses from treatment-naïve patients showed that the inte-\\ngrase gene is very polymorphic, but most of the relevant positions for resistance,\\nsuch as 143, 148 and 155, are conserved (Hackett 2008). \\nRaltegravir: At week 156 of the STARTMRK study in previously therapy-naïve\\npatients, only 4/49 patients had virological failure accompanied by the emergence\\nof raltegravir mutations (Markowitz 2007, Rockstroh 2011). In treatment-experienced\\npatients failing on a raltegravir-based regimen, three  key mutations or resistance\\npathways were observed: N155H, Q148K/R/H and less frequently Y143R/C.\\nMutations observed along with N155H were L74M, E92Q, T97A, V151I, G163K/R,\\nS230R (Steigbigel 2010). In the presence of Q148K/R/H the following mutations may\\noccur: L74M, T97A, E138A/K, G140A, G140S and G163R, whereas mutations at posi-\\ntions 140 prevail. The mutations N155H and Q148K/R/H do not occur on the same\\nviral genome. The accumulation of additional mutations after the emergence of the\\nkey mutations N155H or Q148K/R/H causes an increase in resistance and, depend-\\ning on the pattern of mutations, also an increase in viral fitness.

In order to preserve the efficacy of\\nsecond generation INSTIs (i.e., dolutegravir), raltegravir should be discontinued after\\na first key mutation has occurred. \\nRaltegravir resistance secondary to the mutation Y143H/R/C, for example in\\n combination with E92Q, T97A, V151I, G163R or S230R, is rare (Steigbigel 2010). \\nViral populations harboring the mutation N155H can also be replaced by viral\\n populations harboring Y143C/H/R (da Silva 2010). In viruses of the relatively\\ncommon  HIV-1 subtype CRF02_AG, the mutation G118R will lead to raltegravir\\nresistance (RF=25.2) (Malet 2011).  \\nCaution is needed with raltegravir in patients with existing resistance mutations. The\\ngenetic barrier is not as high as that of boosted PIs (Gatell 2009). In the SWITCHMRK\\nstudy patients on a virologically successful lopinavir/r-based ART were randomized\\nto continue PI or to switch to raltegravir. In the switch arm, virological failure was more\\nfrequent, likely due to archived RAMs, reducing the efficacy of the NRTI backbone.  \\nElvitegravir: With failing first-line therapy of elvitegravir/c plus TDF+FTC, the muta-\\ntions M184V or I, followed by INSTI RAMs are primarily detected. Two Phase III trials\\ndocumented the following mutations within a 3-year follow-up: E92Q (n=5),\\nE92Q+T66I (n=1), E92Q+Q148R+N155H (n=1), E92Q+T66I+N155H (n=1), Q148R\\n(n=2), N155H (n=3) and T97A (n=1) (White 2014). Phenotypic resistance analysis of\\nthese isolates support the result of previous analysis that there is a significant cross-\\nresistance between raltegravir and elvitegravir (Margot 2011, White 2014). In cases\\nof therapy failure, sequencing these two agents should generally not be considered. \\nY143R unlikely occurs with the use of elvitegravir (Metifiot 2011). This mutation\\n(associated with raltegravir), however, does particularly confer cross-resistance to\\nelvitegravir due secondary mutations (Huang 2013).\\nDespite a high level of cross-resistance, the resistance patterns at time of virological\\nfailure differ in part, as shown in a Phase III trial (GS-US-183-0145) of pretreated\\npatients receiving raltegravir or elvitegravir. The most frequently mutations on elvite-\\ngravir were T66I/A (12%) and E92Q (8%) which were not or only rarely seen with\\nraltegravir (Molina 2011, Margot 2011). T66I confers phenotypic resistance to elvite-\\ngravir but not to raltegravir (mean fold-changes 6.6-15 and 0.5-1.4, respectively). In\\ncombination with E92Q, the fold-changes increase significantly for both (190 and\\n18) INSTIs (Kobayashi 2011, Van Wesenbeck 2011, Margot 2012a). According to\\ncurrent data, elvitegravir should not be used when a M184V or I mutation is or has\\nbeen documented. On the other hand, the presence of the INSTI RAM T97A appears\\nto have no effect on the treatment success (White 2014).\\nDolutegravir has a higher genetic barrier than raltegravir and elvitegravir. RAMs\\noccur after several months in cell culture (Canducci 2011, Abram 2012). Depending\\non the laboratory strain used, various mutations were selected for that could not be\\ndetected in clinical study in conjunction with therapy failure. This holds true, for\\nexample, for S153Y and S153S, which decrease the susceptibility of dolutegravir by\\ntwo- to four-fold in vitro(Kobayashi 2011). In other experiments a three-fold decrease\\nin susceptibility was due to the mutations E92Q and G193E. E92Q is the primary\\nmutations selected for with elvitegravir. It is important to note that the clinical\\nthreshold for dolutegravir has not been definitively set regarding resistance. The\\nVIKING-3 study defined a lower cut-off of 9.45 (Vavro 2013). However the calcula-\\ntion of this value was criticized. The actual cut-off may to be lower and needs to be\\ncalculated through further analysis.\\nUsing five clinical HIV-1 subtype B isolates and low-dose dolutegravir concentra-\\ntions, the mutation R263K was selected for after 20 weeks.

Either the mutation R263K or G118R were selected for in the subtype AG\\nisolates; the latter was also detected with subtype C (Quashie 2012). G118R has also\\nbeen detected with raltegravir in subtype CDR02_AG and causes a 3-fold reduction\\nin susceptibility of dolutegravir. However, this mutation has not been observed in\\nPhase III trials, which included mostly patients with subtype B from North America\\nand Europe. Despite R263K confers only weak resistance (resistance factor 1.5-2.1),\\nit can be considered a specific dolutegravir RAM, possibly even defining a specific\\nresistance pathway (Mesplede 2013, Underwood 2013b).\\nTargeted in vitro mutagenesis analysis showed that single primary and secondary\\nINSTI RAMs have no effect on dolutegravir efficacy. Only combinations of muta-\\ntions lead to an increase in resistance factor. Highest values were seen with Q148\\ncombinations. The level of resistance depends on the amino acid substituted at the\\nQ148 position. The combination of E138K with Q148K causes high dolutegravir\\nresistance with a resistance factor of 19±8, while other dual Q148 combinations had\\nlower factors of 2 to 5 in the in vitro mutagenesis analysis. Though N155H has no\\neffect on susceptibility, once combined with E92Q the resistance factor increases to\\n2.5±1.2 compared to wild-type (Kobayashi 2011). The clinical relevance of the\\nN155H/E92Q combination remains to be determined.\\nIn all Phase III trials in therapy-naïve patients treated with dolutegravir plus ABC+3TC\\n(SPRING-2, SINGLE, FLAMINGO), no RAMs were detected. Of note this was also the\\ncase for the NRTI backbone (Raffi 2013, Clotet 2013). In the raltegravir arm of the\\nSPRING-2 study, resistance to INSTIs or to NRTIs was documented for one and four\\npersons with therapy failure (Raffi 2013). This supports the observation that dolute-\\ngravir has a high genetic resistance barrier. Whether or not this is comparable to that\\nof a boosted PI remains to be determined. \\nIn the SAILING trial on INSTI-naïve patients with prior treatment failure, R263K was\\nonce observed alone and once in combination with V260I. R263K was detected once\\nwith each HIV-1 subtype B and C infection and led to a resistance factor of 1.93\\n(Cahn 2013, Pozniak 2013, Undewood 2013). This mutation has been termed a\\n“dead-end” by some study groups, as it strongly impacts viral fitness and no substi-\\ntutions have been identified to date which may offset this. In vitro experiments\\nselected for further mutations which impact viral fitness even more. Further, the\\ndevelopment of NRTI- and NNRTI-RAMs was slower in viruses with the R263K muta-\\ntion as shown by targeted mutagenesis experiments (Oliveira 2014). Yet one needs\\nto consider, that both in vitro and in vivo replicating viruses with this resistance muta-\\ntion have been observed. Hence, in the presence of the R263K, dolutegravir has been\\nrated intermediate resistant in the HIV-GRADE algorithm despite a low resistance\\nfactor. The SAILING Study identified two more patients with resistant virus. One had\\na documented Q148 mutation at therapy start and developed  the mutations T97A\\nand E138T/A with failing therapy. In another patient, viruses with a mutation V151I\\nwere selected for, which alone confers no phenotypic resistance (RF=0.92) (Cahn\\n2103). After unblinding the study and further follow-up, three more patients had\\nresistant virus. Suboptimal adherence was assumed for all three. The mutation R263K\\ncombined with additional secondary mutations was observed. The resistance factor\\nwas 5.8-fold higher than determined by previous experiments of clinical R263K\\nsamples. Furthermore, N155H was detected in two isolates (Underwood 2015). \\nIn the single-arm VIKING Phase IIb Study, 27 patients with a history of or current\\nraltegravir-specific RAMs were treated with dolutegravir 50 mg QD.

Polymorphic sites are observed in all regions of gp41. The\\nheptad repeat 2 (HR2) region has the highest variability. Primary resistance to T-20,\\nthe only fusion inhibitor thus far approved, is a rare phenomenon (Wiese 2005). \\nA loss of efficacy is generally accompanied by the appearance of mutations at the \\nT-20 binding site which is the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) region of gp41. Especially\\naffected are the HR1 positions 36 to 45, such as G36D/E/S, 38A/M/E, Q40H/K/P/R/T,\\nN42T/D/S, N43D/K, or L45M/L. The decrease in susceptibility is greater for double\\nmutations than for a single mutation. Additional mutations in HR2 also contribute\\nto T-20 resistance (Sista 2004, Mink 2005). \\nThe replication capacity (RC) in the presence of HR1 mutations is markedly reduced\\nwhen compared to wild-type virus with a relative order of RC wild-type > N42T >\\nV38A > N42T, N43K > N42T, N43S > V38A, N42D > V38A, N42T.

Solely X4-tropic virus is unlikely but possible (Brumme 2005, Moyle\\n2005, Hunt 2006). X4-tropic virus populations are more frequent with reduced CD4\\nT cell counts, both in naïve and treatment-experienced patients (Brumme 2005, Hunt\\n2006). Only 62% of treatment-naïve patients with a CD4 T cell count of less than\\n200/µl harbored an R5-tropic virus population (Simon 2010).\\nThere are two ways to build up resistance to CCR5 antagonists: a receptor switch\\nfrom R5- to X4- or dual-tropic viruses or the emergence of mutations that enable the\\nvirus to use the CCR5 molecules for entry in the presence of CCR5 antagonists.\\nIn approximately one third of patients on a failing regimen with maraviroc, a shift\\nfrom R5- to X4-tropic virus was reported (Heera 2008).

Retrospective\\nstudies using more sensitive methods have shown that some patients had already\\nharbored minor X4 variants at baseline (Mori 2007, Lewis 2007). \\nSamples of 360 patients from the MERIT-study with R5-tropic virus were reanalyzed\\nusing Trofile\\n® ES, population-based sequencing and ultra-deep sequencing (454-\\nmethod). Genotypic interpretation was performed using the co-receptor tool of\\ngeno2pheno and a FPR-limit of 5.75%. The tropism determined with these three\\nmethods was predictive of therapy success at week 48 and 96 irrespective of subtype\\n(Sierra-Madero 2010).\\nSince not every minor X4 virus population necessarily leads to therapy failure, it\\nremains unclear at which point the higher sensitivity of ultra-deep sequencing (UDS)\\nbecomes clinically relevant, or what proportion of X4-tropic viruses increases the\\nrisk for failure. Samples from the A0041029 and Motivate studies were reanalyzed\\nusing UDS; these were classified as non-R5 if at least 2% were non-R5 virus variants.\\nLow comparable efficacy rates were observed in patients with 2 to 20% non-R5 virus\\nas well as in those with greater than 20% non-R5 (Swenson 2011). Prior to their use\\nin routine clinical care, additional analysis will be necessary to determine the clini-\\ncal relevant limits of the more sensitive tests.\\nOn failing treatment with maraviroc or vicriviroc without a switch in tropism, dif-\\nferent mutations in the V3 loop of the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 were detected.\\nResistance patterns were not uniform and included mutations outside the V3 loop.\\nThe frequency and clinical relevance of these env mutations still require further inves-\\ntigation before any conclusions on resistance can be made. Some of the detected\\nmutations were not associated with an increase in IC\\n50. Instead, phenotypic resist-\\nance was characterized by dose-response curves that display a reduction in the\\nmaximal inhibition (Mori 2008, McNicholas 2009). Reduced maximal inhibition in\\nphenotypic susceptibility assays indicates that viral strains resistant to the CCR5\\nantagonist maraviroc utilize inhibitor-bound receptors for entry (Westby 2007).\\nCross-resistance between maraviroc and vicriviroc has been described after several\\nin vitro passages, but cross-resistance to other CCR5 antagonists or complete class\\nresistance including TBR-652  remains to be determined (Palleja 2010). \\nIt remains unclear if R5-tropic virus with resistance to maraviroc may be suppressed\\nby using monoclonal antibodies such as PRO 140. In contrast to maraviroc or\\n vicriviroc, PRO 140 binds extracellularly to the CCR5 coreceptor. Therefore, cross-\\nresistance between PRO 140 and maraviroc is unlikely (Jacobson 2009).\\nSummary\\nResistance and tropism tests are standard diagnostic tools in the management of HIV\\ninfection and are recommended by treatment guidelines. Primary resistant viral vari-\\nants can be observed in about 10% of treatment-naïve patients in regions that have\\naccess to antiretroviral drugs. Resistance testing prior to initiating ART results in\\n significantly better response rates. The emergence of viral mutants is one of the main\\ncauses of virological treatment failure. Pharmacoeconomic studies have shown that\\ngenotypic resistance tests concerning reverse transcriptase and protease are cost-effec-\\ntive both in treatment-experienced and in ART-naïve patients (Weinstein 2001,\\nCorzillius 2004, Sax 2005). Sequencing of the genomic regions of integrase and gp41\\nshould be included in the evaluation of resistance – at least at time of treatment\\nfailure and when a treatment change is needed. \\nGenotypic and phenotypic resistance/tropism tests show good intra- and inter-assay\\nreliability. The interpretation of genotypic resistance profiles has become very\\ncomplex and requires constant updating of respective guidelines. The determination\\n318 ART'),\n",

Opportunistic Infections (OIs)\\nCHRISTIAN HOFFMANN \\nIn Western industrialized countries, many opportunistic infections (OIs) that in pre-\\nvious years were considered prevalent are now quite rare. This is particularly true for\\ninfections associated with severe immunodeficiency such as CMV and MAC. The\\nincidence of these OIs has been reduced to less than one-tenth of their frequency in\\nthe pre-HAART era (Brooks 2009, Buchacz 2010). ART has not only decreased the\\nincidence of OIs, but it has also changed the course of OIs considerably. In the early\\nyears of the AIDS epidemic, the life expectancy of individuals diagnosed with their\\nfirst AIDS-defining illness was at most two to three years. Today, however, many\\npatients live with AIDS for 15 years or longer. In our own clinical study of 144 patients\\nwith cerebral toxoplasmosis, data from 1990–1993 indicated a 5-year survival rate\\nof 8%; it climbed to 30% by 1994–1996, and to 80% since 1997 (Hoffmann 2007).\\nUp to 90% of patients who develop AIDS or severe opportunistic infections are\\nunaware of their HIV status. Typically, these patients seek medical attention late,\\nwhen their overall health condition is serious. Since AIDS remains life-threatening,\\nevery HIV clinician should be familiar with the diagnosis of OIs and their respective\\ntherapies. Even with recent improvements, many challenges still exist. First, there\\nis still no adequate treatment available for diseases such as PML or cryptosporidio-\\nsis. Second, resistance to treatment has become an increasing problem in OIs \\nsuch as PCP. Even today, OIs like PML have a mortality rate comparable to that of\\nnon-Hodgkin lymphoma (ART-CC 2009). Third, ART does not always lead to \\nimmediate improvement. ART may even complicate things, given the atypical course\\nof a variety of diseases with ART (see the separate section on “Immune Reconstitution\\nInflammatory Syndrome”, IRIS). Fourth, in small HIV centers or regions with low\\nHIV prevalence, diagnostic problems for many OIs may occur, due to a lack of \\nfamiliarity with and inability to recognize these rarer pathogens. Therefore, it is\\nhighly recommended that specimens be sent to specialized reference laboratories. If\\nneeded, further advice can be sought from a specialized clinician or a clinical HIV\\ncenter.\\nThe predominant rule for nearly all OIs is that the poorer the immune status of the\\npatient, the earlier the invasive diagnostic procedures should begin. The primary aim\\nshould not be to spare patients the unpleasant procedures associated with extensive\\ndiagnostic testing. And if the results are inconclusive and nothing is identified the\\nfirst time, diagnostic tests must be repeated. Treatment should be initiated rapidly.\\nThe second rule is that many OIs can be excluded if the immune status is known.\\nTable 1 indicates the CD4 cut-off values and the rates of certain OIs.\\nThe third OI rule is that if ART is not already in place, it should be started as quickly\\nas possible. Immune reconstitution is the best protection against relapses or other\\nOIs. For patients with OIs such as PML or cryptosporidiosis, which have no specific\\ntherapy, starting ART is the best hope. Especially in these cases there is no time to\\nwaste. ART should also be started rapidly in cases of PCP or toxoplasmosis. \\nTable 1: Important cut-offs for CD4 T cells, above which particular AIDS-related illnesses are unlikely.\\nHowever, exceptions are always possible\\nNo cut-off Kaposi’s sarcoma, pulmonary tuberculosis, HZV, bacterial pneumonia, NHL\\n<250/μl PCP , esophageal candidiasis, PML, HSV\\n<100/μl Cerebral toxoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, miliary tuberculosis, HAND \\n<50/μl CMV retinitis, atypical mycobacteriosis\\n332'),\n",

In the last 20 years, there has been significant progress made in\\nunderstanding this organism, especially through DNA analysis (Review: Thomas\\n2004). Although pneumocystis was previously classified as a protozoan, it was estab-\\nlished in 1988 that it is in fact an unusual type of fungus (Edman 1988). In the 1990s,\\nit was recognized that every host, whether rat, mouse, monkey or human, has its\\nown specific pneumocysts. It also became clear that Pneumocystis carinii (P. carinii),\\nwhich was first described in 1910, does not occur in humans at all, but only in rats.\\nThe Pneumocystis species that affects humans is now referred to as Pneumocystis\\njiroveci, and “carinii” has now been taken out of the name, although the abbrevia-\\ntion PCP remains (Stringer 2002).\\nToday, the majority of patients diagnosed with PCP are not on antiretroviral drugs,\\nbecause many of them either do not know their HIV infection status. In Europe\\nbetween 1997–2004, among 760 cases of so-called “late presenters” who were\\n diagnosed with HIV infection and AIDS at the same time,  PCP (35%) was the most\\nfrequent OI (Mussini 2008). In many cases with known HIV infection, adherence to\\nantiretroviral therapy was poor prior to PCP (Denis 2014).\\nPCP is a life-threatening disease, which should be treated by an HIV specialist. It\\noften requires mechanical ventilation and still continues to have a high fatality rate\\nof up to 10% (Walzer 2008, Llibre 2013). Factors associated with mortality are older\\nage, low hemoglobin level, and low partial pressure of oxygen at hospital admission\\n(Walzer 2008, Miller 2010). Relapses seen frequently in the past have become rare,\\nthanks to ART and prophylaxis. Scar tissue formation may result in susceptibility to\\nrecurring pneumothoraces. PCP may rarely occur in relation to immune reconstitu-\\ntion inflammatory syndrome (see below). Extrapulmonary manifestations of pneu-\\nmocystis infections are also considerably rare. They may affect the liver, but many\\nother organs may be involved.\\nSigns and symptoms\\nEvery clinician should be familiar with the classic triad of PCP symptoms that include\\ndry cough, subfebrile temperatures, and dyspnea on exertion; should ask patients\\nspecifically about their symptoms; and should measure the patients’ respiratory rates.\\nA subacute course that allows differentiation from the productive cough, acutely\\nhigh fever, pain and less common dyspnea-associated bacterial pneumonia is typical.\\nOral thrush is a frequent symptom in patients with PCP. Also, substantial weight loss\\nof several kilos in the weeks before PCP diagnosis is common. These and other symp-\\ntoms may be more subtle in cases with suboptimal prophylaxis (rare).\\nWeeks and sometimes even months may go by before the diagnosis of PCP is made.\\nIt is noteworthy to state that decompensation – as with all interstitial pneumonias\\n– often occurs much faster than expected. It is not rare for a patient to suddenly\\nrequire ventilation after weeks of antibiotic therapy prescribed by the primary health\\ncare provider, especially when even “broad spectrum” antibiotics do not help. A\\npatient with significant exertional dyspnea or even resting dyspnea should be\\ndirected immediately to hospital.\\nDiagnosis\\nIf there is clinical suspicion of PCP determined by a physical examination with atten-\\ntion given to respiratory rate, oral thrush, and significant findings on auscultation,\\nthen a chest x-ray should follow without delay and, if possible, a high resolution\\n334 AIDS'),\n",

The chest x-ray often shows relatively\\ncharacteristic findings with a butterfly-shaped (perihilar) interstitial infiltrate. In the\\nearly stages, focus is on the mid- and lower fields. Indistinct, diffuse changes are\\nmore easily visible on HRCT than on a chest x-ray. A CT scan also allows a fairly\\ncertain distinction from other pulmonary infections (Hidalgo 2003). However, in\\ncases where nothing pathological is visible on CT scan to an experienced radiolo-\\ngist, then rapid initiation of treatment is still justified even without a definitive diag-\\nnosis – particularly in the presence of the classic triad of symptoms, low CD4 T cell\\ncount and no previous PCP prophylaxis. Almost always present is partial respiratory\\ninsufficiency, which should be confirmed by arterial blood gas analysis. Lactate\\n dehydrogenase (LDH) is often elevated and may have limited use as a predictive\\nparameter for the course of disease. A high LDH is an unfavorable sign and may\\nreflect the severity of the PCP. In contrast, CRP is often normal, provided there are\\nno other concurrent infections.\\nSputum specimens are generally not useful (Review: Cruciani 2002), so that a\\n bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is usually necessary. This can lead to detection of\\n pneumocysts even after several days of treatment. Therefore, it is not essential to\\nwait for the BAL to start treatment. The lab should be specifically alerted to  possible\\nPCP. The routine test for detecting Pneumocystis in the BAL is direct immunofluo-\\nrescence assay (DFA). A real-time PCR assay also seems to be an accurate diagnosis\\nmethod and could replace the DFA (Fillaux 2008).\\nPerforming the BAL as early as possible also allows for the timely diagnosis of \\nco-infections (CMV , pneumococci). It should be noted that respiratory insufficiency\\ncan deteriorate with BAL. Full blood count, transaminases and kidney function must\\nbe monitored during treatment and baseline values should be determined at this point.\\nNewer diagnostic approaches include antibody testing (Bishop 2003) and measure-\\nment of S-adenosylmethionine, an agent that pneumocysts require but cannot\\nproduce. S-adenosylmethionine levels are significantly reduced in patients with PCP\\n(Skelly 2008). It is currently not foreseeable, whether these tests, which spare patients\\nthe discomfort of bronchoscopy, will be available for routine diagnostic testing in\\nthe future. This also applies to other serum markers such as beta-glucan or antibody\\ntests (Desmet 2009, Watanabe 2009, Djawe 2010, Gingo 2011, Sax 2011). Elevated\\nplasma beta-glucan has an especially high predictive value for diagnosing PCP in\\nAIDS patients with respiratory symptoms (Wood 2013).\\nTreatment\\nGeneral\\nTreatment should be initiated immediately if there is clinical suspicion. In cases of\\nmild PCP (PO\\n2 >70–80 mm Hg), ambulatory treatment can be attempted. In very\\nmild cases, even oral medication can be considered. This may well be possible in\\ncooperation with a competent HIV nursing service. If such monitoring is not possi-\\nble, if respiratory deterioration occurs, and in all cases with resting dyspnea, imme-\\ndiate hospitalization is advised. If ventilation becomes necessary, patients have a\\npoor prognosis, even today (Crothers 2005, Walzer 2008). Non-invasive methods\\n(like CPAP) may be beneficial if used from an early stage. This helps particularly in\\nprevention of pneumothoraces (Confalonieri 2002).\\nThe ACTG study above shows the advantages of starting ART with PCP treatment\\n(Zolopa 2009). Another retrospective study showed improved survival in patients\\nwho began ART while hospitalized (Morris 2003). Possible cumulative toxicities and\\nallergies which may require discontinuation of both PCP and HIV (Watson 2002),\\ncan be largely avoided with newer antiretroviral therapies such as integrase inhibitors. \\nOpportunistic Infections (OIs)    335'),\n",

The drug of choice is cotrimoxazole. The dose\\nof three 960 mg tablets three times daily is possible in milder cases. However, these\\nhigher oral doses are also associated with poor gastrointestinal tolerability. Some case\\nreports have observed positive effects with lower doses, but controlled studies are\\nlacking (Thomas 2009). All severe cases should be treated intravenously in hospital.\\nDue to possible clinical deterioration, which is probably a result of the bursting of\\npneumocysts in the alveoli, 1 mg/kilo prednisone BID should always be simultane-\\nously co-administered with the PCP therapy for 5-10 days. There should be no\\n hesitation to use steroids, especially in patients with poor blood gases. There is\\n evidence from a Cochrane review for a beneficial effect of steroids in adult patients\\nwith substantial hypoxaemia (Ewald 2015). On steroids, significantly less patients\\nneed intubation (Briel 2006). Important: clinical deterioration during the first week\\nof treatment is still not uncommon. Initial treatment should be re-evaluated after\\none week at the earliest, and only after exclusion of coinfections such as CMV.\\nThe high doses of cotrimoxazole require monitoring of full blood count, electrolytes,\\nrenal function parameters and transaminases at least three times weekly. The main\\nproblems in addition to myelotoxicity as well as liver and kidney problems include\\na rash that usually occurs after the middle of the second week of treatment and is\\noften accompanied by drug fever. The rash is seen in up to 30% of patients (Fisk\\n2009) – patients should be checked daily for skin changes! If an exanthema occurs,\\none can attempt to interrupt treatment for one or two days, and then continue with\\nhalf-dose steroids. Otherwise, cotrimoxazole must be discontinued and replaced with\\nalternative treatments.\\nAll alternatives to cotrimoxazole are less effective. In cases of intolerability or history\\nof sulfonamide allergy, intravenous pentamidine is the drug of second choice. An\\ninduction therapy is administered over the first few days (200–300 mg in 500 ml 5%\\nglucose or 0.9% NaCl), and half the dose can be given from day 6. This treatment\\nis very toxic, which is why we have not used it for many years. Severe decompen-\\nsations of electrolyte and blood glucose levels (both hyper- and hypoglycemia) are\\npossible, as well as pancreatitis, arrhythmia and renal failure. Initially, daily moni-\\ntoring of blood glucose, electrolytes and renal parameters is necessary.\\nIn very mild cases of PCP, treatment with daily pentamidine inhalations (300–600 mg\\ndaily for three weeks) can be attempted (Arasteh 1990, Montgomery 1995). However,\\nexperiences have not been all positive (Conte 1990, Soo 1990), and the current US\\nguidelines advise against inhalatory acute therapy (Benson 2004). Instead of pen-\\ntamidine, treatment with atovaquone suspension or a combination of clindamycin\\nand primaquine is possible. However, data on these therapies is only available for\\nmild to moderately severe cases of PCP (Hughes 1993, Dohn 1994, Toma 1998).\\nAccording to a meta-analysis, clindamycin-primaquine seems very promising as\\nsecond-line treatment in patients who fail treatment with cotrimoxazole (Benfield\\n2008) and is superior to pentamidine (Helweg-Larsen 2009). Primaquine should not\\nbe administered to anyone with G6PD deficiency because of a high risk for hemolytic\\nanemia.\\nIn the past few years, these alternative agents have been used only in exceptional\\ncases. It should be mentioned that a 10-day initial therapy of a high dose cotri-\\nmoxazole is achievable in almost all patients, most of whom are then already sig-\\nnificantly better. If exanthema or toxicity forces the interruption of cotrimoxazole\\nbetween day 10 and 14, daily pentamidine inhalation can be administered in the\\nthird and last week of acute therapy. As this is not toxic, it can usually be started in\\nparallel to ART. However, a study on this strategy has yet to be published.\\n336 AIDS'),\n",

Above these\\nvalues, the occurrence of PCP is rare. Therefore, these patients are treated prophy-\\nlactically, ideally with cotrimoxazole. Daily dosages may be slightly more effective\\nthan three times weekly (El Sadr 1999). The gradual lead-in administration over a\\nperiod of 14 days is supposed to prevent allergic reactions, but is cumbersome (Para\\n2000). In cases of a mild or moderate allergy to co-trimoxazole, desensitization after\\nseveral weeks is possible (Leoung 2001), and should definitely be attempted.\\nAlthough dapsone and pentamidine inhalations are almost equally effective\\n(Bozzette 1995, Bucher 1997), co-trimoxazole prophylaxis is better for preventing\\nbacterial infections such as enteritis, sinusitis and pneumonia (DiRienzo 2002). More\\nimportantly, co-trimoxazole simultaneously provides reliable protection for cerebral\\ntoxoplasmosis. Pediatric co-trimoxazole suspension can be used for desensitization,\\nby slowly increasing exposure over six days from 12.5, 25, 37.5, 50 and 75 to 100%\\nof the dose in the 480 mg tablet. In a study of almost 200 patients, no cases of severe\\nallergy occurred, and there was a reduction of fever and headaches. Approximately\\nthree quarters of all patients are thus able to tolerate co-trimoxazole again. However,\\nre-exposure should only be attempted after an interval of eight weeks (Leoung 2001).\\nMonthly inhalation of pentamidine is a well-tolerated alternative. However, cough-\\ning may occur. Asthma attacks are rare, and pneumothoraces are even rarer. A suit-\\nable inhalation system should be used, after administration of a beta-sympath-\\nomimetic agent to dilate the bronchi. The loading dose (300 mg TID for the first\\n5 days) frequently used in the past is no longer a universal standard. In patients with\\nsevere pulmonary disease, inhalation is probably less effective.\\nFurther options are problematic. Dapsone has poor gastrointestinal tolerability, is\\nquite myelotoxic and often leads to elevation of LDH. LDH, an important diagnos-\\ntic parameter, can therefore not be utilized during treatment with dapsone (Ioannidis\\n1996). Atovaquone was proven to be of comparable efficacy to co-trimoxazole,\\ndapsone and pentamidine in two multicenter studies (El-Sadr 1998, Chan 1999), and\\nsince then, is considered to be a good alternative for PCP prophylaxis. The oral sus-\\npension has better tolerability than the tablet formulation (Rosenberg 2001). A sig-\\nnificant disadvantage of atovaquone for long-term prophylaxis is the dispropor-\\ntionately high cost (in some European countries approx. 1000 euro/month).\\nPCP prophylaxis regimens can be discontinued fairly safely with sufficient immune\\nreconstitution: a recent meta-analysis showed that more than 200 CD4 T cells/µl for\\nthree months is required (Costiniuk 2011). PCP has only rarely been described in\\ncases with CD4 T cell counts greater than 200 cells after stopping prophylaxis (Degen\\n2002, Mussini 2003). If the viral load is suppressed, even lower CD4 cells are possi-\\nble. In an analysis of 23,412 patients from 12 European cohorts who started taking\\nART after 1997, the incidence of primary PCP was very low among patients who had\\nvirologically suppressed HIV infection, were receiving ART, and who had CD4 cell\\ncounts of between 101–200 (COHERE 2010). However, there are no controlled studies\\naddressing this issue. Stopping prophylaxis not only reduces side effects and costs,\\nbut also avoids other negative developments: the proportion of co-trimoxazole-resis-\\ntant bacteria is constantly increasing among HIV+ patients (Martin 1999).\\nOpportunistic Infections (OIs)    337'),\n",

Resistance\\nanalyses were previously difficult since this particular organism, even almost\\n100 years after its discovery, can not be easily cultured. However, it is now possible\\nto sequence sections of the genome encoding for dihydropteroate synthetase (DHPS).\\nDHPS is an important enzyme involved in the folate metabolism of many organ-\\nisms, and is targeted by sulfonamides such as sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and dapsone.\\nThe first mutations in the DHPS gene in pneumocysts were discovered in 1997. A\\nfurther study showed DHPS mutations in 43%, while the gene region for dihydro-\\nfolate reductase (DHFR), targeted by trimethoprim (TMP) and pyrimethamine, did\\nnot show a single relevant mutation. In contrast to SMX, there seems to be no selec-\\ntive pressure associated with TMP – a suspicion that has to be analyzed, that TMP is\\nnot effective against pneumocysts (Ma 1999). Recently, however, even DHFR muta-\\ntions have been proven (Nahimana 2004). In addition, studies in large groups of\\npatients have demonstrated that the frequency of sulfa resistance mutations has\\n significantly increased in recent years. Resistance correlated significantly with the\\nduration of prior prophylaxis and its failure (Helweg-Larsen 1999). However, it\\nremains unclear whether DHPS mutations should affect decisions on PCP therapy\\nor lead to a change in treatment (Review: Matos 2010). \\nThe sequencing of the Pneumocystis genome has uncovered other possibly relevant\\nfindings: it seems highly likely that PCP is caused by a new infection, rather than\\nthe reactivation of an existing infection as previously assumed (Wakefield 2003).\\nAsymptomatic HIV+ patients with frequent detection of pneumocysts may have\\nreservoirs (Wakefield 2003), as well as HIV-negative patients on corticosteroid therapy\\n(Maskell 2003) and patients with active PCP.

TE almost always results\\nfrom the reactivation of a latent infection with Toxoplasma gondii, an intracellular\\nparasite that infects birds, mammals and humans. Prevalence rates vary consider-\\nably worldwide (Porter 1992). Whereas Toxoplasma gondii is relatively rare in the US,\\nseroprevalence rates in some regions within central Europe are as high as 90%.\\nToxoplasma gondii has an affinity to the CNS. Extracerebral organ manifestations\\n(heart, muscle, liver, intestine, lung) are rare and often only detected at autopsy.\\nAltough prognosis has been markedly improved with antiretroviral therapy, cerebral\\ntoxoplasmosis is potentially life-threatening, especially during the first weeks.\\nTreatment remains complicated. In severe cases, there may be residual neurological\\nsyndromes with significant disabilities, like hemiparesis. It is not rare to see a life-\\nlong susceptibility to seizures as a result of defective healing. It should be noted that\\nrelapses may occur even after long periods of time due to intracerebral persistence.\\nIn Western countries, there is some evidence that the situation of an HIV+ patient\\ndeveloping TE in recent years differs from TE patients seen during the early years of\\nthe HIV epidemic (Hoffmann 2007). Patients with TE today usually are not taking\\nantiretroviral therapy or prophylaxis of any sort. They are likely to be diagnosed\\nwith HIV at the time of TE diagnosis, and TE is much more frequently the AIDS-\\ndefining illness in these patients than in the pre-HAART era. \\nSigns and symptoms\\nClinical symptoms depend on the localization of lesions with acute or peracute onset\\nwithin a few days. The major signs include focal neurological deficits such as paresis,\\nspeech problems or sensory loss (Porter 1992). A febrile psychosyndrome with\\n confusion is also a frequent early sign. It is not unusual to see epileptic seizure as\\nthe initial presentation, in the absence of other symptoms. Headaches with fever or\\nsubfebrile temperatures are always suspicious. Meningitic signs, however, are less\\ntypical. Atypical manifestations in patients with immune reconstitution on ART have\\nbeen described (Ghosn 2003).\\nA fairly rare, but important manifestation is Toxoplasma chorioretinitis. It causes\\nimpairment of vision, is an important differential diagnosis to CMV retinitis and\\nmay occur on its own (Rodgers 1996). Toxoplasma chorioretinitis should be treated\\nin exactly the same way as cerebral toxoplasmosis.\\nDiagnosis\\nCerebral toxoplasmosis seldomly occurs above a CD4 T cell count of 100 cells/µl;\\nover 200 CD4 T cells it is very rare (Bossi 1998). In contrast, it should be expected\\nbelow 100 CD4 T cells/µl. A CT or MRI scan of the head should be performed promptly\\nwithin a week in every case of focal neurological deficit, but also if seizures occur in\\nsignificantly immunocompromised patients. In this instance, an MRI is superior to\\na CT scan and almost always shows more visible lesions. A third of cases have  solitary\\nlesions, a third have several (2–5) and a third have multiple lesions. In approximately\\nnine out of ten cases, ring enhancement is found around the lesions, often accom-\\npanied by edema. Hemorrhage may occasionally occur.\\nFor all radiologically detected lesions, the most likely diagnosis is cerebral toxoplasmosis.\\nThe most important differential diagnosis is an “atypical” cerebral toxoplasmosis.\\nThe more lesions there are, the more likely the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis.

Other rare differential diagnoses include PML, infarcts, tuberculomas\\nand cryptococcomas. “HIV-unrelated” diseases such as brain tumors or vascular dis-\\neases should also be considered.\\nA brain biopsy is not obligatory. Suspicion of toxoplasmosis (clinically and radio-\\nlogically) justifies a treatment attempt before biopsy. Response to therapy then con-\\nfirms the diagnosis. However, if the patient does not improve clinically within one\\nweek, or even worsens, then stereotactical brain biopsy cannot be avoided, and in\\nthis case, should not be postponed. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which also does\\nnot necessarily have to be analyzed if there are clear radiological findings (several\\nlesions with contrast enhancement), usually shows moderate pleocytosis and slightly\\nelevated total protein. Our experience with toxoplasma PCR from CSF has not been\\ngood. A negative result never excludes toxoplasmosis.\\nAn updated serology should be available for every patient. Up to 97% of patients\\nwith cerebral toxoplasmosis have IgG antibodies, and so a negative result, which\\nshould be repeated in another lab if there is any doubt, makes toxoplasmosis unlikely.\\nSome clinicians use levels of IgG titers or increased titers as indicators (Derouin 1996),\\nbut this approach has not been properly validated. IgM is only rarely positive, and\\ntherefore usually does not help. PCR from the blood has little relevance (Review:\\nBretagne 2003).\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of cerebral toxoplasmosis is difficult. The most frequently used combi-\\nnations are usually effective (resistance has not yet been convincingly described),\\nbut require modification in at least half of patients due to side effects – particularly\\nallergies. Sulfadiazine and clindamycin are presumably equally effective in combi-\\nnation with pyrimethamine (Dannemann 1992). One large European study demon-\\nstrated a trend, though not significant, in favor of sulfadiazine (Katlama 1996). \\nCo-trimoxazole may also be an option. According to a Cochrane analysis, the avail-\\nable evidence fails to identify a best regimen that can be considered the gold standard\\n(Dedicoat 2006).\\nWe recommend that sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine be used for an initial attempt\\nas oral treatment. In cases of sulfonamide allergy, sulfadiazine should be substituted\\nwith oral or intravenous clindamycin from the beginning. In addition, all disori-\\nented patients should receive clindamycin infusions, at least for adherence reasons.\\nBecause of the high rate of allergies with sulfadiazine, some clinicians oppose clin-\\ndamycin. We do not share this perspective, since clindamycin is also allergenic.\\nMoreover, clindamycin can cause pseudomembranous colitis. \\nA loading dose for pyrimethamine during the first few days has been propagated\\nsince the first published study (Leport 1988). However, it has not been proven nec-\\nessary. Even the dosages vary. For example, in the US, 200 mg is recommended for\\nthe first day (followed by 50-75 mg depending on body weight); in many European\\ncountries, 100 mg is often given for three days, followed by 50 mg. It should be\\nnoted that, in contrast to clindamycin, pyrimethamine is also active in the presence\\nof an intact blood-brain barrier, and therefore, is sometimes the only effective agent.\\nDue to the myelotoxicity of sulfonamides and pyrimethamine, which inhibits trans-\\nformation of folic acid to folinic acid, it is imperative to substitute sufficiently with\\nfolinic acid, which unfortunately is expensive. Folic acid, which is much cheaper, is\\nineffective since it cannot be converted in the presence of pyrimethamine (Luft 2000).\\nGood results have also been reported with intravenous co-trimoxazole, with\\n administration of the same dosages as for PCP (Canessa 1992, Béraud 2009).

Treatment success can be assessed clinically in the first 14 days.\\nWhile an improvement in the symptoms can often be observed within a few days,\\na patient who has not improved after two weeks of therapy or has even deteriorated,\\nprobably does not have toxoplasmosis. If this occurs, the diagnosis has to be reviewed\\nand a brain biopsy must be performed. Changing the TE therapy is not useful in\\nsuch cases and just expends valuable time. Antiretroviral therapy should be initiated\\nas soon as possible. Drugs with the potential of allergic reactions (abacavir, when\\nHLA testing is not possible, NNRTIs, fosamprenavir, darunavir) should be avoided. \\nA control MRI is recommended for stable patients after two weeks at the earliest.\\nSignificant resolution of lesions is often only visible after four weeks. In cases of\\nincreased intracranial pressure or extensive edema, steroids are given (8 mg dexam-\\nethasone q 6–8 h). Steroids should be given for a limited time, as there is a signifi-\\ncantly increased risk of aspergillosis. All treatment combinations require initial\\n monitoring of blood count, glucose, transaminases and renal parameters at least\\nthree times weekly. Maintenance therapy with the reduced dose should only be\\n initiated if lesions have shrunk by at least 75%.\\nProphylaxis\\nExposure prophylaxis: IgG-negative patients can protect themselves from primary\\ninfection by not eating raw or undercooked meat (lamb, beef, pork, game, etc). It\\nhas not been proven, despite widespread opinion, that infection occurs by mere\\ncontact with cats, the definitive hosts of Toxoplasma gondii. To date, the only study\\nthat has seriously investigated this conjecture could not prove endangerment as a\\nresult of proximity to cats (Wallace 1993). Nevertheless, stricter measures of hygiene\\nshould be followed (e.g., gloves should be used when handling the litter box).\\nPrimary prophylaxis: All IgG-positive patients with less than 100 CD4 T cells/µl\\nrequire primary prophylaxis. The drug of choice is co-trimoxazole. In cases of \\nco-trimoxazole allergy, desensitization may be considered (see PCP). An alternative\\nis dapsone plus pyrimethamine or high-dose dapsone. Primary prophylaxes can be\\ndiscontinued safely if CD4 T cells are above 200/µl for at least three months.\\nMaintenance therapy/secondary prophylaxis: In the absence of immune recon-\\nstitution, patients with cerebral toxoplasmosis require lifelong maintenance therapy\\nor secondary prophylaxis, as there are otherwise recurrences in nearly all cases. It\\nusually consists of half the dose of the acute therapy (Podzamczer 2000). Clindamycin\\nis presumably less suitable as it cannot cross the blood-brain barrier (Luft 2000). Co-\\ntrimoxazole seems to be not as effective for secondary prophylaxis, but should be\\nconsidered because it is simple. However, it definitely requires higher doses than\\nthose used to treat PCP (Ribera 1999, Duval 2004). With immune reconstitution (at\\nleast six months above 200 CD4 T cells), secondary prophylaxis can probably be\\nstopped (Benson 2004, Miro 2006). When possible, an updated MRI scan should be\\navailable beforehand. If there is enhancement, then it may mean that lesions have\\nbecome active even after years – and there is a risk of a recurrence.

In many countries, seroprevalence\\nis around 50–70%, and above 90% in MSM. In severely immunocompromised indi-\\nviduals (CD4 count below 50 cells/µl), reactivation of CMV infection can lead to\\nretinitis. In the past, CMV retinitis was a common AIDS-associated illness, leading\\nto blindness in up to 30% of patients. It occurs mainly in untreated patients, who\\nare often first diagnosed with HIV infection on presentation (Jacobson 2000). An\\ninflammatory CMV retinitis, usually with severe vitritis, is also possible in the course\\nof IRIS (see below). If CMV retinitis is not diagnosed and treated promptly, then the\\npatient’s sight is at risk. Impairment of vision is almost always associated with lesions,\\nwhich are no longer reversible even with adequate treatment. This is why CMV retini-\\ntis remains a dangerous illness, although the prognosis has significantly improved\\nwith ART (Salzberger 2005, Thorne 2006).\\nOther manifestations of disseminated CMV infection are rare (15%), and can affect\\nevery organ. The lung (pneumonia), esophagus (ulcers), colon (colitis) and CNS\\n(encephalitis) are most frequently involved. Sinusitis may also occur (Jutte 2000).\\nThe clinical signs of these CMV diseases depend on the organ affected. Diagnosis is\\noften difficult and may only be possible on histology (Goodgame 1993). There is\\ninsufficient data on the treatment of these manifestations, so systemic therapies are\\nusually chosen along with treatment for CMV retinitis (Whitley 1998). \\nNewer studies have suggested that CMV infection plays a role in the pathogenesis\\nof artery disease and that CMV-induced T cell immunopathology could contribute\\nto HIV-associated atherosclerosis (Parrinello 2012, Sacre 2012). There is also an asso-\\nciation between CMV infection and altered immune reconstitution (Appay 2011,\\nWittkop 2013). \\nSigns and symptoms\\nAny visual impairment occurring peracutely or acutely, such as blurred vision or\\nfloaters – especially unilaterally – should prompt an immediate (same day, if possi-\\nble) ophthalmological examination of the patient. Symptomatic CMV retinitis is an\\nemergency. Once there is a black spot in the visual field, it will be permanent.\\nInvolvement of the posterior pole (zone 1 retinitis) accounts for approximately one\\nhalf of incident visual acuity loss. Cataract and retinitis-related retinal detachment\\nare also common causes of vision loss (Thorne 2006).\\nAll CMV treatment regimens can prevent progression of lesions, but not reverse\\nthem. Eye pain, burning, increased production of tears, and conjunctival irritation\\nare not typical. However, many patients suffer from systemic symptoms such as fever\\nand weight loss.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made by fundoscopy. Assessment of the usually peripheral, whitish\\n exudates is dependent on the experience of the ophthalmologist. However, this can\\nfrequently be a problem, due to the rare occurrence of CMV retinitis nowadays.\\nUnfortunately, incorrect diagnoses do happen and retina are lost. Therefore, if the\\nprimary ophthalmologist remains undecided, it is best to start with oral valgancy-\\nclovir and transport the patient to a larger clinical center with ophthalmologists who\\nare experienced in HIV. Furthermore, it is essential that the ophthalmologists receive\\ninformation about the patient’s immune status. In cases of poor immune status and\\nCD4 count less than 100/µl, chorioretinitis caused by Toxoplasma gondii is the most\\nimportant differential diagnosis. CMV retinitis can almost be excluded at CD4 T cell'),\n",

CMV lesions may also be confused with cotton wool spots, which\\nare not rare in patients with high HIV viral load. Multiple small lesions without\\n hemorrhage or exudates are almost always cotton wool spots, and almost never CMV\\nretinitis. Bilateral involvement is also usually the exception. Vitritis is rare, except\\nwith immune reconstitution syndrome.\\nCMV serology (IgG almost always positive, IgM variable) is seldom helpful for\\n diagnosis. CMV PCR or a blood test for pp65 antigen to detect antibodies against a\\nCMV-specific phosphoprotein may be more useful. CMV retinitis or a recurrence is\\nunlikely with a negative PCR or pp65 result. The higher the levels of CMV viremia,\\nthe higher the risk of CMV disease. Patients with positive CMV PCR have a 3-5-fold\\nelevated mortality risk (Casado 1999, Nokta 2002). Positive CMV PCR is also\\n independently associated with a poor prognosis for the patient (Deayton 2004, Jabs\\n2005, Wohl 2005). As with Toxoplasma gondii, there have been efforts to determine\\nthe antigen-specific immune response more precisely (Jacobsen 2004), although such\\ntesting is not yet routine.\\nTreatment\\nCMV treatment should always be initiated promptly and strictly monitored by fun-\\ndoscopy at least once a week in the beginning. Photodocumentation is advisable.\\nInitially, an intensive induction therapy is administered for two to three weeks, until\\nthere is scar formation of the lesions. HIV clinicians and ophthalmologists should\\nwork closely together, particularly during the induction therapy, and when possible,\\ncommunicate several times a week. Induction therapy is followed by maintenance\\ntherapy at a reduced dose.\\nART in particular has dramatically improved the prognosis of patients. That said, all\\ndiagnosed patients should start ART without delay. This can restore CMV-specific\\nimmune responses (Komandouri 1998), so that CMV viremia may disappear even\\nwithout specific therapy after a few weeks (Deayton 1999, O’Sullivan 1999). However,\\nif retinitis is present, CMV-specific treatment should also be started, as immune recon-\\nstitution may take several months. Treating asymptomatic CMV patients with CMV\\nagents remains controversial. There is some evidence that preemptive therapy lowers\\nthe incidence of CMV end-organ disease in some patients with CMV viremia\\n(Mizushima 2013). However, monitoring of potential treatment-related side effects\\nis required. Treating a positive CMV IgM serology (without any further diagnosis) is\\nnot only expensive, but also usually an unnecessary risk.\\nSystemic treatment \\nValganciclovir, a prodrug of ganciclovir with good oral absorption, is the first choice\\nin CMV treatment. In a randomized study (Martin 2002) on 160 patients with retini-\\ntis valganciclovir tablets were just as effective as ganciclovir infusions. However, the\\ntoxicity profile of both agents was comparable. This means that the blood count has\\nto be as frequently monitored as for infusions and that the indication has to be\\nequally carefully set. However, there are some experts in the field who prefer intra-\\nvenous CMV treatment to oral treatment in advanced cases.\\nOther options for systemic treatment have become less important, and are only used\\nin cases of recurrence. If there is intolerability or more rarely (Martin 2007) resist-\\nance to valganciclovir (Drew 1999), then foscarnet remains an option. This, however,\\nrequires daily infusions. Further problems with this drug include nephrotoxicity, and\\nvery painful penile ulcers. Very intensive hydration of the patient is therefore nec-\\nessary in all circumstances.'),\n",

We observed\\ncreatinine elevations in every second patient treated, despite the fact that a strict\\ninfusion plan was closely followed (see Drugs section).\\nNewer anti-CMV drugs are under investigation. Maribavir failed to show a benefit\\nin Phase III studies (Snydman 2011). Letermovir is a new agent with a novel mech-\\nanism of action targeting the CMV terminase. In a Phase II trial, letermovir was effec-\\ntive in reducing the incidence of CMV infection in recipients of allogeneic\\nhematopoietic-cell transplants, with an acceptable safety profile (Chemaly 2014).\\nThe drug has been granted fast track status by FDA and orphan drug status by EMA.\\nAdditional treatment with G-CSF (filgrastim) improved survival in one analysis of\\nthree large studies enrolling patients with CMV retinitis in the years 1990–1997. In\\nparticular, there was a reduction of bacterial infections. However, the reason for this\\npositive effect remains unclear. Thus, administration of filgrastim is presently not\\ngenerally recommended (Davidson 2002).\\nLocal treatment \\nSeveral options for local treatment of CMV retinitis have been tested (Review: Smith\\n1998). Although such treatments can be safely administered by experienced\\n ophthalmologists and are associated with few complications (infections, hemor-\\nrhage), disadvantages remain. Weekly intravitreal injections of ganciclovir or fos-\\ncarnet, or pellet implantation (Vitrasert\\n®, must be replaced every 6–9 months) do\\nnot protect from infection of the contralateral eye or from extraocular manifesta-\\ntions (Martin 1999). The same is true for fomivirsen (Vitravene\\n®), an antisense-\\noligonucleotide for intravitreal injection, which is astonishingly effective even with\\nmultiresistant CMV strains (Perry 1999).

There is also no effective vaccine.\\nTherefore, the most important method for prevention in patients with CD4 counts\\nbelow 200 cells/µl is still fundoscopy every three months. With good immune recon-\\nstitution, intervals between examinations can be extended. It is important to perform\\na fundoscopy in severely immunocompromised patients prior to starting ART. This\\nallows detection of smaller lesions, which may later present with severe inflamma-\\ntion during the course of immune reconstitution.\\nSecondary prophylaxis: After approximately three weeks of acute therapy, but at\\nthe earliest with scar formation of lesions, a reduced dose secondary prophylaxis\\n(maintenance therapy) should begin, preferably with oral valganciclovir (Lalezari\\n2002). However, the drug is not only very expensive but also just as myelotoxic as\\nganciclovir infusions. Discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis as quickly as  possible\\nis desirable (Tural 1998, Jouan 2001), but it also requires strict ophthalmologic\\n monitoring. According to US guidelines, discontinuation should occur at the earliest\\nafter six months of maintenance therapy and with an immune reconstitution above\\n100–150 CD4 T cells/µl. However, we have successfully stopped ganciclovir at lower\\nCD4 counts, if both HIV and CMV PCR in blood were below detection. One study\\nshowed that stopping after 18 months of ART, maintenance therapy can be safe\\nabove 75 CD4 T cells/µl (Jouan 2001). After stopping maintenance therapy, fun-\\ndoscopy should be performed every four weeks over the first months. \\nThe previously required life-long daily infusions of ganciclovir or foscarnet via port,\\npumps and nursing service are luckily now a thing of the past. If there are relapses\\nduring oral valganciclovir, re-induction and maintenance therapy with foscarnet or\\npossibly with cidofovir can be considered.\\nReferences\\nAppay V , Fastenackels S, Katlama C, et al.

Of the 150 Candida species\\nknown to date, only approximately 20 cause disease. By far the most frequent species\\nis C. albicans. Other species such as C. tropicalis, C. glabrata and C. krusei are rare, but\\nmay respond less readily to treatment with azoles. Although it was commonly\\nassumed that azole resistance is a problem particularly with albicans strains, this has\\nnot been the case to date (Sanglard 2002).\\nCandidiasis is an important indicator of immunodeficiency and should be seen as a\\nreason to consider starting ART, even with good immune status. Esophageal\\n candidiasis and even oral thrush often occur following other OIs. Fever, not a classic\\nsymptom of candidiasis, is a particular indication to be on the alert for. If immune\\nstatus is good, it must be remembered that there are also other reasons for thrush –\\nalcoholism and steroid treatment are only two of many possibilities. In addition to\\ncandidiasis of the oropharynx and esophagus, vaginitis is a frequent problem in\\nwomen (also occurring in healthy individuals). Candidemia occurs only rarely in\\nHIV+ patients, even with severe immunodeficiency.\\nSigns and symptoms\\nThe oropharynx is usually affected, with taste disturbances and sometimes a burning\\nsensation on the tongue. White, non-adherent plaques on the buccal mucosa,\\n tonsillar ring and tongue confirm the diagnosis. Involvement of the tongue alone\\nis rare. Occasionally, there may be atrophic candidiasis, which presents only with\\nan erythematous mucosa.\\nCandida esophagitis usually occurs with oropharyngeal involvement, but in about\\none third of cases there is no oral thrush. It often presents with dysphagia (“drink-\\ning is ok, but food can’t go down”) and retrosternal pain. Some patients complain\\nof nausea, although vomiting occurs only rarely.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis in the oropharynx can be made based on clinical appearance. A swab is\\nnot usually required. Characterization by culture or even determination of drug sus-\\nceptibility (beware laboratory uncertainty!) is only advised if a treatment attempt\\nwith fluconazole or itraconazole has failed. Oral candidiasis is not to be confused\\nwith oral hairy leukoplakia (OHL). In contrast to candidiasis, the whitish, hairy\\nplaques of OHL, on the sides of the tongue, cannot be scraped off. OHL is not caused\\nby fungi but by EBV , and is an important disease marker for HIV , even if it is harm-\\nless and does not require treatment.\\nCandida esophagitis can also initially be diagnosed clinically. Dysphagia, retrosternal\\npain and oral candidiasis make the diagnosis very probable. Empiric fluconazole\\ntherapy reduces costs (Wilcox 1996). Upper GI endoscopy is only required if com-\\nplaints persist. To distinguish fluconazole-resistant esophageal candidiasis from\\nherpes or CMV esophagitis, samples of lesions should always be taken. In contrast,\\ndetermination of serum antibodies or antigen is always unnecessary.\\nTreatment\\nWith relatively good immune status at first presentation, treatment with topical\\nantimycotics such as nystatin, amphotericin B or miconazole can be attempted.\\nHowever, systemic treatment is usually necessary. This is more effective and prevents\\nrelapses for longer (Pons 1997).'),\n",

In this large randomized study,\\na single dose of 750 mg of fluconazole was safe, well tolerated, and as effective as\\nthe standard 14-day fluconazole therapy (Hamza 2008).\\nIf symptoms last for more than a week, a swab should be taken and the daily flu-\\nconazole dose may be increased to 800 mg for the second attempt. Itraconazole\\nshould only be used if the second treatment attempt fails and non-albicans strains\\nhave been found. It will be effective in approximately two thirds of cases (Saag 1997).\\nAlthough itraconazole suspension is as effective as fluconazole (Graybill 1998), we\\ndo not primarily use it as plasma levels are unreliable and there are problems due to\\nnumerous interactions.\\nA new alternative are miconazole mucoadhesive tablets. These tablets adhere to the\\noral mucosa and provide sustained local release of miconazole over a period of several\\nhours with just one daily application. Miconazole has recently been approved in\\nEurope (Loramyc\\n®) and the USA (Oravig™) for the treatment of oropharyngeal\\n candidiasis (Lalla 2011). In a large trial, miconazole was shown to be noninferior to\\ntreatment with clotrimazole 10 mg troches 5 times daily for 14 days in HIV+ patients\\n(Vasquez 2010). Trials comparing miconazole with oral fluconazole are lacking.\\nSeveral new and promising antimycotics have been developed in recent years.\\nHowever, these should only be used in clear cases of fluconazole resistance. There is\\ninsufficient evidence on the superiority of these drugs in the treatment of non-\\nresistant candidiasis (Pienaar 2006). Voriconazole is expected to be as effective as\\n fluconazole, but is possibly not tolerated as well (Ruhnke 1997, Ally 2001). This may\\nbe also true for posaconazole (Vasquez 2006). Like amphotericin B, these new azoles\\nshould only be used for treatment of multi-azole resistant mycoses. \\nThe new antimycotic class of echinocandins has good efficacy, among them drugs\\nsuch as caspofungin, micafungin or anidulafungin. These drugs showed similar\\n efficacy and tolerability to intravenous fluconazole for treatment of candida\\nesophagitis in randomized studies (Villaneuva 2001, de Wet 2004, Reboli 2007).\\nHowever, these drugs can only be administered intravenously which restricts their\\nuse to azole-resistant candidiasis.\\nAntiretroviral therapy should be initiated when such mycoses occur, particularly\\nwith multiresistant strains, as these usually disappear with sufficient immune recon-\\nstitution (Ruhnke 2000).\\nTreatment/prophylaxis of candidiasis(daily doses)\\nAcute therapy Duration: 5–10 days\\nIn mild cases Topical e.g., amphotericin B 1 lozenge QID or\\nnystatin suspension 1 ml QID\\nTreatment of choice Fluconazole Fluconazole 1 x 1 cap at 100 mg for oral candidiasis\\nFluconazole 1 x 1 cap at 200 mg for esophageal \\ncandidiasis (twice the dose on the first day in each case) \\nAlternative Itraconazole Itraconazole 1–2 cap. at 100 mg BID or\\nItraconazole suspension 10-20 ml BID (1 ml = 10 mg) \\nProphylaxis Not recommended\\n352 AIDS'),\n",

In 2013, an estimated \\n9.0 million people developed TB and 1.5 million died from this disease, of whom\\n360,000 were HIV-positive (Figure 1, WHO 2014). TB-related deaths in people living\\nwith HIV have fallen by 33% in the last decade (UNAIDS 2014). Although it is\\n recommended that every TB patient should be tested for HIV , only about 48% of TB\\npatients had a documented HIV test globally. Mortality during treatment is more\\nthan three times higher among HIV-positive TB patients (11% versus 3.4%). \\nHigh rates of HIV and tuberculosis coinfection are found in Africa (e.g., Lesotho and\\nSwaziland 74%) but also in some European countries (estimated numbers) like Latvia\\n(20%), Portugal (18%) and Ukraine (16%) (ECDC 2015).\\nThe TB epidemic is closely related to the HIV prevalence in the general population\\nwith an >8 times higher risk for the development of TB in HIV+ individuals (Corbett\\n2006). The incidence of TB has continuously declined in countries where ART is\\navailable (Liu 2015). Nevertheless, patients with advanced immunodeficiency remain\\nat high risk of developing TB. Clinical management of coinfected patients is com-\\nplicated due to a long duration of dual therapy, a wide range of drug-drug interac-\\ntions, adverse events of medications and high demands on a patient’s compliance\\ndue to a substantial pill burden.\\nAdditional information can be found in recent reviews (Swaminathan 2010, Curran\\n2012, Dierberg 2013, Lawn 2013, Lee 2013).\\nInteraction of HIV and M. tuberculosis\\nHIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infections have synergic influence on host\\nimmune regulation.

A large part of pulmonary TB cases occurs\\nin patients with more than 200 cells/µl (Badri 2001). However, the incidence of\\n disseminated TB is much higher in patients with advanced immunodeficiency (Wood\\n2000).\\nThe incidence rate ratio for TB in HIV+ persons versus uninfected persons has been\\nestimated to range from 20.6 (95% confidence interval, 15.4–27.5) to 36.7 (11.6–\\n116) (Getahun 2010). The risk of TB is already enhanced in the first year after HIV-\\nseroconversion (Sonnenberg 2005). Low CD4 T cell counts, late presentation, low\\nbody mass index, anemia, ongoing viral replication and diabetes mellitus are known\\nTB risk factors (Van Rie 2011, Ronacher 2015, Sester 2015). In turn, it is likely that\\nTB enhances the immunodeficiency related to HIV infection (Toossi 2003).\\nClinical manifestations\\nIn the early stages of HIV infection the clinical symptoms of TB are similar to those\\nin HIV-negative patients. Fever, fatigue, night sweats and weight loss are common. \\nPulmonary TB: As in HIV-negative cases, typical lesions of pulmonary TB in HIV+\\npatients with more than 200 CD4 T cells/µl are upper lobe lung infiltrates (with or\\nwithout cavities). Opacities are often present on chest radiography as well as enlarged\\nmediastinal lymph nodes. As immunodeficiency progresses, atypical pulmonary pre-\\nsentations or TB pleuritis become more frequent. Bronchopulmonary symptoms are\\noften absent when TB occurs in the advanced stages of HIV infection. Because CD4\\nT lymphocytes are required for granuloma formation their cellular structure changes\\nwith increasing immunodeficiency (Diedrich 2011). With the progression of immun-\\nodeficiency, hematogenous and lymphatic spread of mycobacteria is more common\\nleading to miliary or disseminated TB or localized extrapulmonary TB (Elliott 1993).\\nMiliary or disseminated TB:Clinical manifestations depend on multiple small gran-\\nular lesions (lat. milium effusum) and their localization. Lungs may be involved and\\nmicro-nodular opacities are evident on chest x-ray. On radiological criteria alone,\\nthese lesions cannot be distinguished from pulmonary cryptococcosis. Miliary dis-\\nsemination of TB can also involve the abdomen. In febrile patients with abdominal\\npain and ascites, peritoneal TB must be included in the differential diagnosis. \\nExtrapulmonary TB occurs predominantly in patients with CD4 T cells below\\n200/µl, most commonly affecting the cervical lymph nodes (Schutz 2010). Lymph\\nnodes are enlarged, hard and generally not painful on palpation. The formation of\\nabscesses and draining fistulas as well as fever and malaise are common.\\nTuberculosis meningitis often emerges with ambiguous prodromal symptoms such\\nas headache, nausea and vomiting followed by elevated temperature and clinical\\nsigns of meningeal irritation. The basal meninges are usually involved and cranial\\npalsies of the III and VI nerves are common. Mono-, hemi- or paraparesis as well as\\nloss of consciousness and seizures can occur. In any patient with symptoms and signs\\nof meningitis, a lumbar puncture should be performed without delay.\\nOther extrapulmonary localizations include pericarditis, osteoarthritis, the uro-\\ngenital tract and the skin. Tuberculosis lesions may involve adrenal glands causing\\nAddison’s disease. Practically, any organ can be involved.\\nOpportunistic Infections (OIs)    355'),\n",

Pulmonary\\nTB can mimic a variety of other pulmonary diseases and can be present without\\nevident changes on chest radiography. However, typical chest radiographic findings\\nare ill-defined single or multiple opacities in the upper lobe, with or without  cavities\\ninside the opacities, and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.

In case of doubt, a chest CT scan is recommended\\nwhenever possible. If extrapulmonary TB is diagnosed, lung radiographic imaging\\nas well as abdominal ultrasound should be performed to identify possible pulmonary\\ndisease, liver and spleen abscesses, thickening of the intestinal mucosa or ascites.\\nRespiratory samples: When pulmonary TB is suspected, 2-3 sputum samples should\\nbe collected on consecutive days for mycobacterial culture and direct sputum smear\\nexamination for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Sputum quantity (>3-5 ml) and its origin from\\nthe lower respiratory tract are essential. \\nIf patients are unable to cough deeply or cannot produce sputum, induced sputum\\nshould be provoked by 10–15 minutes inhalation of hypertonic sodium (3%)  chloride.\\nThe collection of early morning gastric aspirate is an alternative if bronchoscopy is\\nnot available. The aspirate should be buffered in phosphate solution immediately.\\nBronchoscopy is indicated when the clinical findings remain highly suspicious for\\nTB. Bronchial secretions or bronchoalveolar lavage obtained by bronchoscopy do\\nnot allow a more sensitive or specific diagnosis of TB than sputum smear in patients\\nwith HIV infection (Conde 2000). However, bronchoscopy is very helpful in the\\n differential diagnosis of TB and other diseases particularly since co-existence of\\nseveral pulmonary diseases is frequent in HIV+ patients (Narayanswami 2003).\\nFurthermore, histopathological examination of transbronchial biopsies may show\\ntypical tuberculosis granulomas. On the day after bronchoscopy, sputum should be\\ncollected as the microscopic yield is higher following the intervention even if no\\nmycobacteria is detected in lavage fluid.\\nMycobacterial culture:Sputum and all other materials (including heparinised blood,\\nurine, fluids, biopsies) should always be sent for culture that detects M. tuberculosis\\nwith a high sensitivity and specificity. The gold standard is culture identification of\\nM. tuberculosis after incubation of biological samples preferentially in liquid or in\\nsolid media. Liquid media takes less time (2–4 weeks) than solid media (3-5 weeks)\\nto obtain a positive result. A culture is only considered negative if no mycobacteria\\nare identified after 6–8 weeks of incubation. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM)\\nusually grow much faster and can often be identified within two weeks. All new\\n clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis should undergo drug susceptibility testing for first-\\nline and in case of MDR-TB for second-line antibiotics.\\n356 AIDS'),\n",

At least 5,000–10,000\\nmycobacteria per slide are necessary to achieve a positive result in a routine setting.\\nApproximately 50% of all patients with culture positive pulmonary TB have unde-\\ntectable AFB on three consecutive sputum samples. AFB positive smears are present\\nin approximately 5% of cases where pulmonary lesions are not visible on standard\\nchest radiography (Ackah 1995). Specificity of direct sputum microscopy is poor.\\nDiscrimination between M. tuberculosis and other acid-fast bacteria is not possible by\\nmicroscopy. A confirmatory test for MTB is required. The differential diagnosis\\nincludes infections with NTM, Nocardia spec. and Rhodococcus spec. Microscopy in\\nHIV+ patients with more than 200 CD4 T cells/µl and typical radiographic changes\\nhas the same yield as in negative patients. With advanced immunodeficiency, the\\nlikelihood of an AFB positive smear decreases (Chamie 2010).\\nBiopsies of the lymph nodes, pleura, peritoneum, synovia and pericardium and\\n diagnostic fluid aspirates from all anatomic compartments are suitable for AFB\\nmicroscopy and histological examination for typical granulomas. \\nNucleic acid amplification (NAAT): Mycobacterial nucleic acid can be detected in\\nbiological samples by a routine automated NAAT (e.g., Xpert\\n® MTB-Rif, Cepheid –\\nrecommended by WHO). M. tuberculosis NAAT is faster than culture and more\\n sensitive and specific than sputum smear microscopy. NAAT is especially helpful for\\ndifferentiation of mycobacterial species when AFB are visible on microscopy. Under\\nthese circumstances, the sensitivity of MTB PCR is >95% (Boehme 2010).\\nUnfortunately, the sensitivity decreases when smear negative morning sputa are\\n analysed directly (Rachow 2011, Boehme 2010) or in paucibacillary disease (Jafari\\n2013, Threon 2011). The Xpert\\n® MTB-Rif allows the detection of mutations in the\\nrpoB gene resulting in rapid identification of rifampicin resistance as a proxy for\\nMDR-TB (Boehme 2011). Because Xpert\\n® MTB-Rif can yield false positive results for\\nrifampicin resistance, especially in countries with low MDR-TB prevalence, reports\\nshould always be interpreted within the clinical context. Line probe assays (Hain-\\nLifescience, AID – recommended by WHO) allow rapid molecular detection of addi-\\ntional mutations in the genome of M. tuberculosis, e.g., in the katG, inhA, rrs, gyrA/B\\nand emb genes, that correlate to phenotypic drug resistance. In the future, it will be\\npossible to evaluate the whole bacterial genome for such mutations in order to tailor\\nthe initial choice of drugs in M/XDR-TB according to the results of molecular drug-\\nresistance analysis (Walker 2015).\\nThe diagnostic accuracy of M. tuberculosis NAAT in formalin fixed material is not\\nknown. For NAAT analysis biopsy samples should be preserved in normal saline or\\nin “HOPE” (HEPES-glutamic acid buffer mediated organic solvent protection effect)\\nmedia (Olert 2001), not in formalin.\\nDiagnosis of latent infection and preventive therapy\\nIn the absence of active TB, a positive M. tuberculosisadaptive immune response iden-\\ntified by the tuberculin skin test (TST) or an interferon-/H9253release assay (IGRA) defines\\nlatent infection with M. tuberculosis (LTBI) (Mack 2009). The WHO suggest to screen\\nall HIV+ persons by TST or IGRA and to provide preventive chemotherapy for all\\nwith a positive test result (Getahun 2015). Neither TST nor IGRA can distinguish\\nlatent infection from active or past disease. Immunodiagnostic testing is part of the\\nTB prevention strategy. Once active TB has been ruled out (as much as possible) TST\\nand IGRAs should be used to identify individuals with the highest risk for future\\ndisease development among individuals from TB risk groups. \\nOpportunistic Infections (OIs)    357'),\n",

Only a few studies have evaluated TB progression\\nrates in relation to TST and IGRA testing in HIV-infected patients (Aichelburg 2009,\\nSester 2014). According to a recent study from Europe, HIV+ patients with a viral\\nload >50 copies/ml have the highest risk for progression to TB among immuno-\\ncompromised hosts (Sester 2014). \\nDisease progression can be effectively prevented by chemotherapy (Bucher 1999, Elzi\\n2007, Sester 2014). In HIV+ persons with ongoing viral replication from Western\\nEurope the number needed to treat to prevent one case of TB was less than 10 when\\nTST was used for screening. A 6-month prophylactic course of isoniazid (INH) reduced\\nthe incidence of TB among HIV+ subjects from about 11.5 to 4.9 per 100 person\\nyears (Grant 2005, Charalambous 2010). Therefore, a 6–9 month course of INH (300 mg\\ndaily) and pyridoxine is usually recommended for the treatment of LTBI in low inci-\\ndence countries. A treatment regimen consisting of rifapentine 600 mg and INH 900 mg\\nonce weekly for 12 weeks was shown to be non-inferior to a 9 month daily treat-\\nment regimen, but few HIV+ individuals were included in this trial (Sterling 2011).\\nIn high burden TB countries INH preventive chemotherapy was shown to be more\\neffective when administered for 36 months vs. 6 months in TST positive individu-\\nals with HIV infection (Samandari 2011). However, the effect wears off when \\npreventive treatment is discontinued (Churchyard 2014). \\nInfection control \\nMost patients develop disease after recent transmission, emphasising the need for\\npatient-to-patient infection control measures (Horsburgh 2010, Houben 2011,\\nSonnenberg 2001). Isolation is generally indicated to prevent the spread of the infec-\\ntion. Effective treatment according to the drug resistance profile of the TB case seems\\nmost relevant to control infectiousness also in HIV+ TB patients (Escombe 2008).\\nRecent evidence suggests that effectively treated, although smear and culture-\\npositive, cases might not be infectious any more (Dharmadhikari 2014). Until further\\nevidence is gathered, culture negativity seems the safest marker of non-infectious-\\nness for drug-susceptible and drug-resistant cases. In pulmonary TB sputum should\\nbe regularly collected (weekly in the initial phase, later monthly), evaluated for AFB\\nby direct microscopy and for viable M. tuberculosis by culture until the end of treat-\\nment (Lange 2014).\\nTB therapy \\nDrug susceptible TB is treated with the first-line drugs rifampicin (RIF), isoniazid\\n(INH), pyrazinamide (PZA) and ethambutol (EMB). INH and especially RIF are the\\nmost potent first-line drugs. Streptomycin (SM) is only rarely used, e.g., in some\\ncountries recommended as part of a TB-meningitis treatment regimen. To prevent\\nthe development of drug resistance, active TB should always be treated with a\\n combination of four drugs in the initial phase. The standard therapy consists of a \\n2-month course of daily RIF, INH, EMB and PZA, followed by a continuation phase\\nof 4 months with daily RIF and INH.

Clinical data on the combined use of bedaquiline and delamanid are not\\nyet available. \\nTiming of ART and TB therapy\\nOptimal timing of ART in HIV/TB patients was investigated in three randomized\\nclinical trials, namely SAPIT, CAMELIA and STRIDE (Abdool Karim 2011, Blanc 2011,\\nHavlir 2011). Patients with particularly low CD4 T cells benefit from early ART ini-\\ntiation. It is recommended to start ART in patients with CD4 T cells below 100 cells/µl\\nlatest after two weeks of TB treatment. At higher CD4 T cells, ART can be initiated\\nbetween 8 and 12 weeks post-start of TB treatment (EACS 2014). US guidelines\\n recommend that ART should be initiated between 2–4 weeks in patients who have\\na CD4 T cell count of 50-200 cells/µl and evidence of clinical disease of major sever-\\nity, low Karnofsky score, low BMI, low hemoglobin, low albumin, or organ system\\ndysfunction (OARAC 2015). A recent trial suggests that ART can be delayed until \\n6 months after TB treatment initiation in patients with CD4 T cells above 200 cells/µl\\n(Mfinanga 2014). Another recent trial tested empiric TB treatment versus IPT in\\npatients with advanced HIV (median CD4 T cell counts 18 cells/µl) in high incidence\\n settings. There was no difference in mortality after 24 weeks (Hosseinipour 2015).\\nIn cases of drug-resistant TB, controlled data on ART initiation are not available.\\nAccording to expert opinion, ART should be started 2–4 weeks post TB treatment\\n initiation (OARAC 2015). Pregnant women should also start ART as soon as possi-\\nble in order to prevent mother-to-child transmission.\\nDrug interactions and ART regimen during TB treatment \\nThere are many pharmacological interactions between ART and anti-tuberculosis\\ndrugs. The enzyme induction of cytochrome P450 3A4/5 by RIF requires particular\\nattention. As rifampicin and PIs are both metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A, con-\\ncomitant therapy is generally not recommended (OARAC 2015, EACS 2014).

TB-associated IRIS has been reported to\\noccur on average in 15% of severely immunocompromised patients although inci-\\ndence data are highly variable (Müller 2010). \\nIn paradoxical TB associated IRIS patients are diagnosed with active TB and initially\\nshow a positive treatment response. However, within three months of initiation of\\nART there is clinical worsening (i.e., lymphadenopathy, infiltrates, effusions, CNS\\nsymptoms). Other causes of clinical worsening (e.g., drug resistance, drug toxicity,\\nother opportunistic infections or poor adherence) must be excluded (Meintjes 2008).\\nIt has been suggested that an acute exacerbation of a TH1 immune response against\\nmycobacterial antigens is responsible for the paradoxical reaction in ART experi-\\nenced HIV/MTB coinfected patients (Bourgarit 2006). \\nIn the so-called unmasking TB-IRIS active TB is not diagnosed at the initiation of\\nART, but is diagnosed within 3 months of initiation (Meintjes 2008). It is thought\\nthat the recovery of pathogen-specific immune responses during the initial months\\nof ART trigger the unmasking of a subclinical disease. Screening strategies for under-\\nlying TB need to be carefully emphasized in order to prevent severe unmasking\\n manifestations. \\nThe only randomized controlled trial for the management of paradoxical TB associ-\\nated IRIS used 1.5 mg/kg prednisolone for 2 weeks and 0.75 mg/kg for a further \\n2 weeks. It showed a significant reduction in paradoxical IRIS-related hospital days\\nand outpatient procedures (Meintjes 2010). During TB-associated IRIS, both ART and\\nTB therapy should be continued (OARAC 2015). Two trials investigating meloxicam\\nand prednisolone for the prevention of TB-IRIS are ongoing. As in patients with TB\\nmeningitis and HIV infection the risk of IRIS-related mortality is high, and it is\\n recommended to start ART in TB meningitis patients 8 weeks after starting the TB\\ntherapy (Törok 2011).\\nAdverse events\\nThe most frequent and significant adverse events of TB drugs are listed in Table 1.\\nINH should routinely be coadministered with prophylactic pyridoxine (vitamin B6)\\nto prevent peripheral polyneuropathy.\\nBefore and during therapy with EMB, colour vision should be examined and moni-\\ntored as this drug may affect the optic nerve. Dosages of EMB and PZA need to be\\nadjusted in patients with impaired renal function. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI)\\nis a common problem in the management of HIV/TB coinfection. A consensus state-\\nment of the South African HIV Society gives helpful advice in the management of\\nDILI (Jong 2013). \\nMonthly audiometric monitoring should be performed when streptomycin or\\nsecond-line injectables are used.

Hyperuricemia is\\ncommon when PZA is used. A mild polyarthralgia can be treated with allopurinol\\nand non-steroidal antiphlogistic drugs. Arthralgia can also be induced by RIF and\\nrifabutin. Therapy of drug resistant TB with nephrotoxic injectables (amikacin,\\nkanamycin, capreomycin, streptomycin) in combination with tenofovir should be\\navoided (Kenyon 2011).\\nData on use of bedaquiline and delamanid in patients on ART are rare. Both lead to\\nQTc interval prolongation. QTc interval monitoring is essential for both drugs, par-\\nticular in combination with flouroquinolones, clofazime and clarithromycin (WHO\\n2013, WHO 2014b).\\nPatients who exhibit severe adverse events should always be hospitalized for diag-\\nnosis and treatment. Drugs thought to be responsible for a given adverse event ought\\nto be discontinued. If visual disturbance occurs on EMB, renal failure or shock or\\nthrombocytopenia on RIF and vestibular dysfunction on SM/SLID therapy, re-expo-\\nsure to these agents must be avoided. Other drugs can be reintroduced one by one\\nwhen symptoms resolve, beginning with the drug that is least likely to cause the\\nadverse event. All drugs should be restarted at low doses and doses should be increased\\nstepwise (Table 3). When no adverse effects occur after 3 days, additional drugs can\\nbe added. The drug that is most likely to be responsible for an adverse effect should\\nbe the last one to be restarted if no alternative is available.

Although MAC is by far the most frequent pathogen,\\nnumerous other atypical mycobacterioses exist that cause a similar disease pattern,\\nsuch as M. celatum, M. kansasii, M. xenopi or M. genavense. MAC bacteria are ubiqui-\\ntous and can be found in diverse animal species, on land, in water and in food.\\nExposure prophylaxis is therefore not possible. Consequently, isolation of infected\\npatients is not necessary. While MAC may be detectable in the sputum or stool of\\nasymptomatic patients (colonization), only patients with massive immunodeficiency\\nand less than 50 CD4 T cells/µl develop disease (Horsburgh 1999). This used to\\ninclude up to 40% of AIDS patients in the pre-HAART era (Nightingale 1992). \\nThe infection has now become very rare in industrialized countries (Karakousis 2004).\\nHowever, it remains important, as it has developed into a completely new disease\\nin the ART era. It previously occurred mainly with a chronic, disseminated course\\nof disease, often in patients with wasting syndrome. MAC infections under ART are\\nnow almost always localized and related to immune reconstitution inflammatory\\nsyndrome (IRIS). The disease now occurs with manifestations that were previously\\nnever seen (see below).\\nSigns and symptoms\\nThe symptoms of disseminated MAC infection are unspecific. When the CD4 count\\nis less than 100 cells/µl, fever, weight loss and diarrhea should always lead to con-\\nsideration of atypical mycobacteriosis. Abdominal pain may also occur. As described\\nabove, disseminated MAC infection has now become rare.\\nLocalized forms of atypical mycobacterioses are far more frequent. These include,\\nabove all, lymph node abscesses, which may occur practically everywhere. We have\\nseen abscesses in cervical, inguinal and also abdominal lymph nodes, some of which\\ndeveloped fistulae and resolved only slowly even after surgical intervention. Any\\nabscess appearing whilst on ART (with severe immunosuppression) is highly indica-\\ntive of MAC! In addition to skin lesions, localized forms include osteomyelitis, par-\\nticularly of the vertebrae, and septic arthritis (observed: knee, hand, fingers).\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of the disseminated form is difficult. Blood cultures (heparinized blood)\\nshould always be sent to a reference laboratory. Although atypical mycobacteria\\nusually grow more rapidly than TB bacteria, the culture and differentiation from TB\\nmay take weeks.

Similar to TB,\\nmonotherapy does not suffice. Since 1996, many clinicians prefer the combination\\nof a macrolide (clarithromycin or azithromycin) with ethambutol and rifabutin\\n(Shafran 1996). In the past, this treatment was given lifelong; today it is generally\\nconsidered sufficient to treat for at least six months and until a ART-induced increase\\nin the CD4 T cell count to above 100 cells/µl has been achieved. After publication\\nof data indicating that rifabutin may be omitted from the regimen (Dunne 2000),\\nthe multicenter randomized ACTG 223 study demonstrated a survival benefit with\\nthe triple combination C+R+E compared to C+E and C+R – mortality rates were\\nhalved in the triple combination arm (Benson 2003).\\nDue to the high potential for interactions, rifabutin can be discontinued after several\\nweeks when clinical improvement is observed. The clarithromycin dose should not\\nexceed 500 mg BID. In at least two randomized studies, there was a significantly\\nhigher number of deaths in the treatment arms with a higher clarithromycin dose,\\nfor reasons that remain unclear (Chaisson 1994, Cohn 1999). Instead of clarithro -\\nmycin, azithromycin can also be given, which is cheaper and interacts less with\\ncytochrome P450 enzymes. Azithromycin and clarithromycin have comparable\\n efficacy in combination with ethambutol (Ward 1998).\\nIn disseminated illnesses, treatment should be monitored through regular blood cul-\\ntures. Cultures must be negative by eight weeks at the latest. In the localized form,\\nthe response can be assessed better clinically. Every MAC therapy has a high potential\\nfor side effects and drug interactions. Concomitant medications, including ART,\\nshould be carefully examined – dose adjustments are frequently required and there\\nmay be contraindications (see Drugs section).\\nReserve drugs such as amikacin, quinolones or clofazimine are only required in rare\\ncases today. It is important to perform resistance testing for all atypical mycobacte-\\nrial infections with species other than M. avium complex.\\nWe have generally stopped treatment of localized MAC infections when the abscess\\nhas healed – which usually takes several months. In individual cases, steroids may\\nbe helpful temporarily. However, there are no specific guidelines for treatment of\\nlocal MAC infections.\\nProphylaxis\\nIn the US, large placebo-controlled trials have shown that the macrolides, clarithro -\\nmycin and azithromycin, as well as rifabutin, significantly reduce MAC morbidity\\nand mortality when used for primary prophylaxis in severely immunocompromised\\npatients (Havlir 1996, Nightingale 1992, Pierce 1996, Oldfield 1998). Prophylaxis\\nalso saves costs (Sendi 1999). However, MAC infections are more rare in Europe. As\\na result, and because of concerns over compliance and development of resistance,\\nfew patients in Europe receive primary MAC prophylaxis (Lundgren 1997). \\nFor patients failing currently available ART regimens and without new treatment\\noptions, prophylaxis with a macrolide can be considered at low CD4 T cell counts\\n(<50 cells/µl). Weekly dosing with azithromycin is convenient for patients and has\\ncomparable efficacy to daily rifabutin (Havlir 1996). According to a recent meta-\\nanalysis, azithromycin or clarithromycin appeared to be the prophylactic agent of\\nchoice for MAC infection (Uthman 2013).\\nOpportunistic Infections (OIs)    369'),\n",

Chronic disease is frequent, particularly with severe immunodefi-\\nciency (below 100 CD4 T cells/µl). Two viruses should be distinguished. \\nHSV-1 is transmitted by direct contact with mucosal membranes such as kissing, and\\ncauses the typical, itchy perioral blisters on the lips, tongue, gums, or buccal mucosa. \\nHSV-2 is sexually transmitted and leads to lesions on the penis, vagina, vulva and\\nanus. HSV-2–associated lesions significantly increase the risk of HIV transmission\\n(Freeman 2006, see Prevention). \\nIn severe cases, other organs may be affected. These include mainly the esophagus\\n(ulcers), CNS (encephalitis), eyes (keratitis, keratoconjunctivitis, uveitis) and respi-\\nratory tract (pneumonitis, bronchitis). In such cases and with persistence of lesions\\nfor a period of more than four weeks, herpes simplex infection is an AIDS-defining\\nillness.\\nSigns and symptoms\\nThe typical blisters itch and burn. Oral involvement may impair food intake. In cases\\nof genital or anal herpes (proctitis), urination and defecation can be very painful.\\nExtensive lesions may occur with severe immunosuppression. Regional lymph nodes\\nare often enlarged. The clinical symptoms of disseminated disease depend on the\\norgans affected.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of oral, genital or perianal herpes can often be made clinically. If there is\\ndoubt, then swabs should be taken, placed in viral culture media, and quickly trans-\\nported to the laboratory. The diagnosis of organ manifestations usually requires\\n histology. Diagnosis is particularly difficult for HSV encephalitis, as cerebrospinal\\nfluid often does not help. Serologies are only useful if they are negative, therefore\\nmaking HSV infection improbable.\\nTreatment\\nEvery treatment, whether topical, oral or systemic, is more effective when started\\nearly. For patients with a good immune status and only discrete lesions, topical treat-\\nment with acyclovir cream or ointment is adequate. Penciclovir cream is probably\\nas effective as acyclovir (Chen 2000) and allegedly less irritant, although significantly\\nmore expensive. \\nThe nucleoside analog acyclovir remains the treatment of choice for systemic treat-\\nment. Acyclovir inhibits the DNA polymerase of herpes viruses. Resistance is rare,\\ndespite the fact that this agent has been used since 1977 and numerous generics are\\nnow available (Levin 2004). Acyclovir is usually well tolerated and effective against\\nboth HSV-1 and HSV-2. Severe cases with mucocutaneous or organ involvement\\nshould be treated immediately intravenously. As CNS levels are lower than in plasma,\\nthe dose should be increased to treat encephalitis. If acyclovir is to be given intra-\\nvenously, renal blood values should be checked.\\nValacyclovir and famcyclovir are equally effective alternatives to acyclovir (Ormrod\\n2000, Conant 2002), though substantially more expensive. The main advantage is\\ntheir improved oral bioavailability; they require less frequent dosages. In cases of\\nrecurrent genital herpes lesions shorter therapeutic regimens (i.e., two days of fam-\\nciclovir) may be as effective as standard 5-day courses (Vinh 2006, Bodsworth 2008).  \\nBrivudine remains a good alternative for HSV-1 and HZV (zoster). However, it is pos-\\n372 AIDS'),\n",

However, a meta-analysis of almost 2000\\npatients in eight randomized studies showed that acyclovir can reduce the risk of\\nboth HSV and HZV disease by more than 70%. Even mortality was reduced by 22%\\n(Ioannidis 1998). The introduction of ART has changed the relevance of this data.\\nNevertheless, it can still make sense, even today, to treat persistent recurrences with\\nlong-term low-dose acyclovir or valacyclovir (DeJesus 2003, Warren 2004).

High dose valacyclovir\\nresulted in a slightly greater reduction of HIV replication (Mugwanya 2011, Perti\\n2013). Even the rate of disease progression can be reduced. In a large randomized\\ntrial in Uganda, acyclovir showed a significant clinical benefit, with the greatest effect\\nin individuals with a high baseline viral load (Reynolds 2012). \\nDespite the fact that acyclovir does not prevent the transmission of HIV (Celum\\n2008+2010, Watson-Jones 2008), these results have recently revived the interest in\\nacyclovir therapy (Vanpouille 2009). This old drug has become interesting again.\\nPossibly new derivatives will be developed that are better tolerated and more effec-\\ntive in terms of HIV antiviral potency. \\nOpportunistic Infections (OIs)    373'),\n",

Herpes zoster\\nepisodes can occur even in HIV+ patients with relatively good immune status, and\\nare also seen during immune reconstitution (Martinez 1998). Given the still high\\nincidence of zoster episodes in HIV+ patients, herpes zoster can be regarded as an\\nindicator disease for HIV infection (Søgaard 2012, Moanna 2013). With more\\nadvanced immunodeficiency, herpes zoster tends to become generalized. In addition\\nto involvement of one or more dermatomes, dangerous involvement of the eye\\n(affecting the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve, “herpes zoster\\n ophthalmicus”, with corneal involvement) and ear (herpes zoster oticus) may occur.\\nMost feared is involvement of the retina with necrotizing retinitis. The neurological\\ncomplications include meningoencephalitis, myelitis and also involvement of other\\ncranial nerves (Brown 2001).\\nSigns and symptoms\\nThere are often prodromal signs with headache, malaise, and photophobia, accom-\\npanied only rarely by fever. The affected areas are initially hypersensitive, and then\\nbecome pruritic and/or painful within hours or days. Pain can precede lesions by\\nseveral days. Lesions often show segmental, yet always unilateral, erythema with\\nherpetiform blisters within one or more dermatomes. Lesions ulcerate, are often\\n hemorrhagic, and gradually dry up. They should be kept dry and clean to avoid\\n bacterial superinfection. Involvement of several dermatomes often leaves treatment-\\nresistant pain syndromes with zoster neuralgia. Post-herpetic neuralgia can be\\nassumed if pain persists for more than a month (Gnann 2002).\\nDiagnosis\\nCutaneous involvement usually allows clinical diagnosis of herpes zoster. However,\\ndiagnosis may be difficult especially on the extremities and in complicated zoster\\ncases. Typical cases do not require further diagnostic tests. If there is uncertainty, a\\nswab may be taken from a blister and sent to the laboratory in viral culture media.\\nAn immunofluorescence assay is presumably more reliable. HZV encephalitis is only\\ndetectable through analysis of CSF by PCR. Herpes zoster oticus should be consid-\\nered in cases of unilateral, peracute hearing loss, which is not always visible from\\nthe outside. Either examine the ear yourself or consult an ENT specialist! For visual\\nimpairment the same rules apply as for CMV retinitis – refer the patient to the oph-\\nthalmologist as quickly as possible.\\nTreatment\\nMonosegmental zoster can be treated on an outpatient basis with oral acyclovir.\\nRapid initiation of treatment is important. Systemic therapy is always necessary, and\\ndoses are higher than for HSV. Lesions dry up more rapidly if calamine lotion is used,\\nwhich also relieves pain. Gloves should be worn, given that the lesions are highly\\ninfectious initially. Likewise, unvaccinated individuals without a history of chick-\\nenpox should not come into close contact with a case of herpes zoster.\\nAnalgesics (novaminsulfone, or better still tramadole) should be given generously.\\nAny complicated, multi-segmental or facial herpes zoster should always be treated\\nwith intravenous therapy. \\nAs with HSV , several alternatives for treatment include valacyclovir, famcyclovir and\\nbrivudine (see HSV). There is still controversy if the unpleasant post-herpetic neu-\\nralgia allegedly occurs less frequently under these drugs than under acyclovir (Li\\nOpportunistic Infections (OIs)    375'),\n",

Valacyclovir, famcyclovir and brivudine have not been tested\\nwidely in HIV+ patients, and are not licensed for treatment of immunocompromised\\npatients. They are also substantially more expensive than the numerous acyclovir\\nformulations. Acyclovir resistance may occur in the thymidine kinase gene, but is\\nrare (Gershon 2001, Saint-Leger 2001). In these cases, foscarnet can be given. Novel\\nanti-HZV drugs have recently been evaluated in clinical trials but are still in early\\nphases of development (Review: Andrei 2011).\\nPain management of post-herpetic neuralgia is problematic.

It is caused by\\nJC virus (JCV), a polyoma virus found worldwide. JCV was named after the initials\\nof the first patient John Cunningham, from which this simple DNA virus was first\\nisolated in 1971 (Major 1992). Therefore, JC has no connection, as is often wrongly\\nassumed, with Jakob-Creutzfeld syndrome. As seroprevalence is high, at up to 80%,\\nlatent persistent infection is assumed. Kidneys and bones seem to be important reser-\\nvoirs. Only impaired cellular immunity leads to reactivation of JCV and manifesta-\\ntion of disease. It seems certain that JCV reaches the CNS via leukocytes, and then\\naffects mainly oligodendrocytes and consequently the cells which comprise the\\nmyelin sheaths. Destruction of these is as macroscopically apparent as multifocal\\ndemyelination. The main focus of the disease is the white matter of the cerebral\\nhemispheres, but in some cases, the cerebellum, the grey matter may also be affected.\\nPML is a classic opportunistic infection and can occur in patients with hematologi-\\ncal diseases or during therapy with monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, natal-\\nizumab or efalizumab (Yousry 2006, Carson 2009, Major 2010). However, HIV+\\npatients are by far the largest patient group. Severe immunodeficiency is frequently\\nseen, but not obligatory for development of PML. In contrast to CMV or MAC infec-\\ntion, PML does not always indicate the final stages of HIV infection. Although CD4\\nT cells are usually below 100/µl at manifestation of disease, PML may also occur at\\nabove 200 CD4 T cells/µl (Gasnault 2008). The decrease in incidence is not as marked\\nas with other OIs (Engsing 2009). After cerebral toxoplasmosis, it is now probably\\nthe second most common neurological OI (Antinori 2001).\\nPrognosis was poor in the pre-HAART era. The median interval between the onset\\nof the first symptoms and death was between 3 and 6 months. Patients usually died\\nof secondary complications after being bedridden for many weeks. Disease progres-\\nsion seems to be much slower on ART, and even complete remission seems possible\\n(Albrecht 1998). However, these effects are not as impressive as for other OIs (Falco\\n2008, Engsing 2009) and PML remains the OI with the highest mortality (ART-CC\\n2009). Complete remission is rarely seen, even with sufficient ART. They mainly\\noccur in cases of inflammatory PML, which occurs in the course of immune recon-\\nstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) (Du Pasquier 2003, Hoffmann 2003, Tan\\n2009). The number of CD4 T cells and the JC virus-specific immune response seem\\nto be relevant as prognostic markers. In contrast, JCV viral load does not seem to\\nhave any impact on the course of the disease (Khanna 2009, Marzocchetti 2009). \\nSigns and symptoms\\nAlthough there is a broad spectrum of PML symptoms due to the variety of localized\\nareas of demyelination, the clinical signs and course of the disease have several common\\ncharacteristics. In addition to cognitive disorders, which may range from mild impair-\\nment of concentration to dementia, focal neurological deficits are very typical of PML.\\nMono- and hemiparesis are observed most frequently, as well as speech and even\\nvisual deficits. We have seen several blind patients with PML. These deficits may be\\nisolated and initially present as discrete changes in coordination, rapidly leading to\\nconsiderable disabilities. Epileptic seizures may also occur. Loss of sensibility, fever,\\nand headache are rare and are usually more typical of cerebral toxoplasmosis.\\nDiagnosis\\nClinical suspicion of PML should be rapidly confirmed radiologically. But beware: a\\nCCT scan is not helpful – it does not clearly reveal hypodense lesions.

ART may result in inflammatory courses that involve\\nsignificant enhancement (see IRIS). Exclusion of grey matter is typical – since this is\\na leukoencephalopathy. Furthermore, it should be noted that the lesions are almost\\nalways asymmetrical.\\nAn MRI often allows clarification between cerebral toxoplasmosis or lymphoma.\\nHowever, the huge, extensive lesions covering an entire hemisphere that are often\\nshown in the literature are not always present. Every PML starts small – very discrete,\\nlocalized, solitary lesions can occur and certainly do not exclude the diagnosis. PML\\ncan occur anywhere in the brain, and there are no typically susceptible areas. Lesions\\nare often parieto-occipital or periventricular, but the cerebellum may also be\\ninvolved. It is important that the images are assessed by a radiologist or clinician\\nfamiliar with PML. Even then, it is difficult to distinguish PML from HHV-6 infection\\n(Caserta 2004) or HIV leukoencephalopathy (Langford 2002).\\nClinicoradiological diagnosis is therefore not definitive. Examination of cerebro -\\nspinal fluid is essential. Generally, if there is no other coinfection, unspecific inflam-\\nmatory signs are absent although the total protein content is usually slightly ele-\\nvated. Pleocytosis is rarely seen, and more than 100/3 cells make PML unlikely. CSF\\nshould always be tested for JCV. Newer PCR methods have a sensitivity of around\\n80% and a specificity of over 90%. A CSF sample should be sent to a JCV-experi-\\nenced laboratory.\\nPML is very probable in cases of clinicoradiological suspicion and positive JCV PCR.\\nIn such cases, brain biopsy is not necessary. Nevertheless, a negative PCR does not\\nexclude the diagnosis. Levels of JCV viral load may vary significantly and do not\\ncorrelate with the extent of lesions (Eggers 1999, Garcia 2002, Bossolasco 2005).\\nUnfortunately, JCV PCR is even less useful – many patients with PML have a low or\\nundetectable JCV CSF viral load while on ART (Bossolasco 2005). Stereotactic brain\\nbiopsy may become necessary in individual cases. Recently, a consensus statement\\nhas been published which establishes detailed criteria for PML diagnosis (Berger\\n2013).\\nTreatment\\nA specific PML treatment is not available. Foscarnet, interferon, immune stimulants,\\nsteroids, camptothecin/topotecan or cytosine arabinoside are not effective (Hall\\n1998). Unfortunately, this is also the case for the nucleotide analog cidofovir, which\\nis licensed for CMV retinitis. According to an analysis of 370 patients from numerous\\nstudies (De Luca 2008), a real benefit has not been proven for cidofovir. Our\\n experiences have been rather disappointing and, in a retrospective analysis of 35\\npatients, cidofovir was even associated with a poorer prognosis. However, this chiefly\\nreflects the frustration of patients and clinicians – cidofovir was mainly used in cases\\nof progressive disease (Wyen 2004). There may no longer be an argument for the use\\nof cidofovir in PML patients. \\nIn recent years, 5-HT2a inhibitors and/or serotonin receptor antagonists have been\\nproposed for PML treatment. It has been shown that the serotonergic receptor\\n5HT2AR could act as the cellular receptor for JCV on human glial cells (Elphick 2004);\\nthe blockade could represent a therapeutic goal. Case studies for some agents such\\nas risperidone and mirtazapine, which block serotonergic receptors, exist already\\n(Verma 2007, Focosi 2007+2008, Cettomai 2009). However, controlled studies are\\nmissing.

Only recurring, radiologically and\\nculturally detected acute\\npneumonia (more than one episode in the last 12 months) is considered AIDS-defin-\\ning.

Low CD4 T cell counts and\\nan existing liver cirrhosis are major risk factors for severe cases (Manno 2009,\\nMadeddu 2010). \\nNosocomial pneumonia is often caused by hospital germs such as klebsiella, staphy-\\nlococcus, pseudomonas (Franzetti 2006). In such cases, treatment depends on local\\nresistance patterns and experience (Gant 2000, Vogel 2000).\\nSigns and symptoms/diagnosis\\nAcute, usually high, fever and productive cough are typical. Breathing may be painful\\nbecause of accompanying pleuritis, but real dyspnea is rare. Auscultation almost\\nalways allows distinction from PCP. If something can be heard, then PCP is unlikely.\\nChest radiography secures the diagnosis. CRP is significantly elevated, LDH usually\\nnormal. It is essential to take several blood cultures at body temperatures above\\n38.5˚C before starting treatment. A major problem regarding the blood culture is\\nthat diagnosis takes time (24–48 hours) and is not so sensitive. However it is the\\nonly procedure that allows a resistance test. Sputum culture is a simple method allow-\\ning determination of etiology in approximately half of all cases – however, its overall\\nutilization remains controversial and results strongly depend on the clinician’s expe-\\nrience (Cordero 2002). This also applies to the pneumococcal antigen determination\\nin urine and the diagnosis of other specific viruses which are not recommended in\\ncurrent guidelines (Tessmer 2010).\\nTreatment\\nGeneral\\nTreatment of bacterial pneumonia in HIV+ patients is similar to that in HIV-nega-\\ntive patients. Therapy should always begin empirically, without waiting for sputum\\nor blood culture results. Many HIV+ patients with bacterial pneumonia can be treated\\nas outpatients. Patients with poor immune status below 200 CD4 T cells should be\\nhospitalized (Madeddu 2010), as well as patients with high fever (above 39.5˚C), poor\\ncompliance, signs of organ failure, CNS disorders (confusion) or poor vital signs\\nOpportunistic Infections (OIs)    381'),\n",

It is\\nmainly caused by the protozoon Cryptosporidium parvum (two genotypes exist, geno-\\ntype 1 is now also known as C. hominis) and may affect both immunocompetent\\nand immunocompromised hosts (Review: Chen 2002). First described in 1976, cryp-\\ntosporidia are among the most important and most frequent causes of diarrhea world-\\nwide. Important sources of infection for this intracellular parasite include animals,\\ncontaminated water and food. The incubation period lasts approximately 10 days.\\nWhile diarrhea almost always resolves within a few days in otherwise healthy hosts\\nor in HIV+ patients with CD4 counts greater than 200 cells/µl, cryptosporidiosis is\\noften chronic in AIDS patients. Particularly in severely immunocompromised\\npatients (<50 CD4 T cells/µl), diarrhea may become life-threatening due to water\\nand electrolyte loss (Colford 1996). Only chronic, and not acute, cryptosporidiosis\\nis AIDS-defining.\\nSigns and symptoms\\nThe typical watery diarrhea can be so severe that it leads to death as a result of elec-\\ntrolyte loss and dehydration. Up to twenty bowel movements a day are not uncom-\\nmon. Tenesmus is frequent, along with nausea and vomiting. However, the symp-\\ntoms are highly variable. Fever is usually absent. Additionally, the biliary ducts may\\noccasionally be affected with the elevation of biliary enzymes. Pancreatitis is also\\npossible.\\nDiagnosis\\nWhen submitting stool samples, the laboratory should be informed of the clinical\\nsuspicion. Otherwise, cryptosporidia are often overlooked. If the lab is experienced\\nand receives the correct information, usually just one stool sample is sufficient for\\ndetection. In contrast, antibodies or other diagnostic tests are not helpful. The dif-\\nferential diagnosis should include all diarrhea-causing pathogens.\\nTreatment\\nNo specific treatment has been established to date. Diarrhea is self-limiting with a\\ngood immune status; therefore, poor immune status should always be improved with\\nART – and this often leads to resolution (Carr 1998, Miao 2000). To ensure absorp-\\ntion of antiretroviral drugs, symptomatic treatment with loperamide and/or opium\\ntincture, a controlled drug prescription, at its maximum dosage, is advised. If this is\\nunsuccessful, then treatment with other anti-diarrheal medications, perhaps even\\nsandostatin, can be attempted. Sufficient hydration is necessary and infusions may\\neven be required.\\nRecent reviews confirm the absence of evidence for effective agents in the manage-\\nment of cryptosporidiosis (Abubakar 2007, Pantenberg 2009). We have observed good\\nresults with the antihelminthic agent nitazoxanide (Cryptaz\\n®). Nitazoxanide proved\\nto be effective in a small, randomized study (Rossignol 2001). In 2005 it was licensed\\nin the US for treatment of cryptosporidia-associated diarrhea in immunocompetent\\npatients. Nitazoxanide is not approved for AIDS patients and showed no effects in\\na double-blind randomized study in HIV+ children with cryptosporidia (Amadi 2009).\\nRifaximine (Xifaxan\\n®, 200 mg) is a nonabsorbed rifampicin derivative, already\\nlicensed in the US as an anti-diarrheal.

In the US and especially in Southeast Asia, cryptococcosis occurs much more\\nfrequently and is considerably one of the more prominent AIDS-defining illnesses\\nworldwide. Presumably transmitted via inhalation, bird droppings are a key reser-\\nvoir for C. neoformans. This pulmonary infection may remain subclinical in immuno-\\ncompetent patients, but is almost always followed by disseminated disease in HIV+\\npatients. Apart from the lungs, the main manifestation after hematogenic spread is\\nin the CNS. For this reason, a CSF examination is obligatory in every suspected case.\\nHowever, isolated skin manifestations and lymphadenitis can also occur. Organ\\ninvolvement, such as in the urogenital or gastrointestinal tract, is rare.\\nCryptococcosis almost always occurs with severe immunodeficiency. In a collection\\nof 114 cases, 87% had less than 100 CD4 T cells/µl; the median CD4 count was 30\\n(Weitzel 1999). Many cases seen today occur in the setting of an immune reconsti-\\ntution inflammatory syndrome. Cryptococcosis is fatal if untreated. Treatment is\\nlengthy, complicated and should be managed only on an inpatient basis. Relapses\\nwere frequent in the pre-HAART era and occurred in at least 15% of cases. In  addition,\\ncryptococcosis occurs relatively frequently in the presence of an immune reconsti-\\ntution inflammatory syndrome. Prognosis has much improved over the last years.\\nIn one study from France, the mortality rate per 100 person-years was 15 in 1996–\\n2000, compared with 64 in the pre-HAART era although early mortality did not differ\\nbetween the two periods (Lortholary 2006).\\nSigns and symptoms\\nThe CNS manifestation with encephalitis is the most frequent manifestation (ca.\\n80%). Patients complain mainly of headaches, fever and confusion or clouding of\\nconsciousness which progresses rapidly over a few days. Disorders of gait, hearing,\\nand vision may occur, as well as paresis, particularly of the cranial nerves. In such\\ncases intracranial pressure is almost always increased. However, meningeal symptoms\\nare usually absent. In the course of an immune reconstitution syndrome, clinical\\nsymptoms are often atypical and characterized by extensive abscesses (Manfredi\\n1999).\\nPulmonary disease leads to symptoms of atypical pneumonia with unproductive\\ncough and chest pain. Skin lesions can initially resemble molluscum contagiosum,\\nand later become confluent in the form of larger, ulcerative lesions.\\nDiagnosis\\nCryptococcosis is life-threatening, and the mortality rate in larger studies is between\\n6 and 25% (Saag 2000). There is no time to lose during diagnostic testing. Rapid\\nexamination of the lungs (HRCT) and CNS in particular (MRI) should be initiated\\nin every suspected case (e.g., positive cryptococcal antigen test). \\nThe chest x-ray usually does not reveal much; therefore, an HRCT scan must be per-\\nformed if pulmonary involvement is suspected. The spectrum of morphology on the\\nimage is very variable.

Nevertheless, intracranial pressure is often increased and a fundoscopy\\n(papillary edema) should be performed.\\nThe most important test for cryptococcosis is lumbar puncture after a fundoscopy\\nand/or an MRI. Diagnosis can be made via India ink stain in almost all cases. CSF\\nmust be examined even in cases with pulmonary or other manifestations to exclude\\nCNS involvement. Cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) in the blood (titer >1:8) is a good\\nparameter and should always be determined, especially in patients with low CD4 T\\ncell counts (Jarvis 2011). Blood cultures are also often positive. With cutaneous\\ninvolvement, the diagnosis is usually made from a biopsy.\\nTreatment\\nIn cases of CNS involvement an immediate combination of antimycotics is urgently\\nrecommended followed by maintenance therapy with fluconazole (Saag 2000).\\nFluconazole alone is not sufficient, even in high doses, as shown by two random-\\nized trials from Africa. In these trials, mortality of cryptococcal meningitis was\\n unacceptably high. Within the first weeks, 54–59% of the patients died (Longley\\n2008, Makadzange 2009). \\nCombination prevents resistance and allows reduction of acute therapy to 4-6 weeks.\\nThe choice of combination is not clearly defined. In some countries, combination\\ntherapy with the three antimycotics amphotericin B, flucytosine and fluconazole is\\noften used for meningitis. The triple therapy leads to complete remission of\\n meningitis in around 80% of cases (Weitzel 1999), and consequently the possibility\\nof a slightly higher rate than under dual therapy with amphotericin B and flucyto-\\nsine as favored in the US (van der Horst 1997). \\nHowever, other data raises questions as to the superiority of triple therapy. According\\nto the measurements of cryptococcal clearance in the CSF, two small randomized\\nstudies in Thailand and Vietnam, the combination of amphotericin B and flucyto-\\nsine was the most effective treatment (Brouwer 2004, Day 2013). It was even\\n significantly better than triple therapy and also amphotericin B and fluconazole.\\nAmphotericin B at a dosage of 1 mg/kg plus is possibly more rapidly fungicidal than\\nis standard-dose amphotericin B (Bicanic 2008). If amphotericin B is not available,\\nthe combination of flucytosine and fluconazole is better than fluconazole alone\\n(Nussbaum 2010).\\nNevertheless, in view of the toxicity of flucytosine, available in many countries only\\nin infusion and not in tablet form, the combination of amphotericin B and flu-\\nconazole is preferable. In a Phase II study the high doses of 800 mg fluconazole daily\\nwas most effective (Pappas 2009). A newer study showed that the efficacy of high\\ndose fluconazole is equivalent to flucytosine (Loyse 2012). \\nIn addition to having significantly lower toxicity, liposomal amphotericin\\n(Ambisome\\n®) is slightly more effective than conventional amphotericin B (Leenders\\n1997, Hamill 1999). However even Ambisome®-containing combinations are highly\\ntoxic. Daily monitoring of kidney and liver enzymes, blood count and electrolytes\\nare recommended. Fluconazole should be administered as an infusion, particularly\\nif patients seem confused. \\nIn untreated patients, ART is typically started during the acute phase of treatment.\\nCaution should be taken with tenofovir, given an observed case of renal failure requir-\\ning dialysis after treatment with tenofovir and amphotericin B.

In the Swiss cohort of over 9000 patients, only 22 cases\\nof recurring salmonellosis were documented over a period of nine years (Burkhardt\\n1999). \\nIn Southern Europe as well as Africa, salmonellosis is much more frequent.

In addition to septicemia, atypical infections with\\nosteomyelitis, empyema, pulmonary abscesses, pyelonephritis or meningitis have\\nbeen described (Albrecht 1992, Nadelman 1985).

Although\\nthe pathogens, pathogenesis and localization were very different, all these illnesses\\nhad a distinct inflammatory component and were associated with significant\\nimmune reconstitution in these patients. Consequently, it was suspected early on\\nthat these presentations could constitute a syndrome during which a latent infec-\\ntion present at initiation of therapy is fought more effectively by the recovering\\nimmune system (Overview: French 2009). Infections are not the only cause of IRIS.\\nMalignancies and other diseases have also been decribed as IRIS-related (see below).\\nThe International Network for the Study of HIV-associated IRIS (INSHI,\\nhttp://www.med.umn.edu/inshi/) has established the following consensus criteria\\nfor diagnosis of IRIS: \\n1. Response to ART (at least one log\\n10 copies/mL decrease in HIV RNA)\\n2. Clinical deterioration of an infectious or inflammatory condition temporally\\nrelated to ART initiation.\\n3. Symptoms cannot be explained by expected clinical course of a previously rec-\\nognized and successfully treated infection, medication side effect or toxicity, treat-\\nment failure or complete non-adherence.\\nOne must differentiate between subclinical infections first appearing on ART\\n(“unmasking IRIS”) and clinically evident infections already existing at therapy ini-\\ntiation, which often paradoxically become worse during therapy (“paradoxical IRIS”).\\nIRIS in many publications today is often a collection of bizarre, sometimes grotesque\\ncase reports, which have actually only one thing in common: an unexpected, usually\\nclinically impressive infection, differing significantly from the course of disease seen\\nduring the pre-HAART era. Nevertheless, IRIS has three rules:\\n\\x81 Anything is possible.\\n\\x81 Nothing is as it was in the pre-HAART era.\\n\\x81 IRIS does not mean that ART has failed. In fact, patients usually have a good prog-\\nnosis.\\nHow frequently does IRIS occur? Due to the lack of a definition in the early years of\\nART, the data vary substantially. In our experience, a frequency of 5–10% in patients\\nwith less than 200 CD4 T cells/µl is realistic. Very low CD4 T cells, a high viral load\\nbefore initiation of therapy or a rapid drop of HIV RNA on ART seem to be impor-\\ntant predictive factors for IRIS. If one focuses on patients who were already infected\\nwith mycobacteria or cryptococcus neoformans before ART was started, IRIS rates of\\n30% can be reached (Müller 2010).\\nMycobacterial IRIS. For MAC, the number of published cases with grotesque, fis-\\ntular lymphadenitis, cutaneous or muscular abscesses, osteomyelitis, nephritis or\\nmeningitis is too large to be cited here. After a total of 83 patients started ART with\\na CD4 T cell count of less than 200/µl, only six mycobacterioses, among these\\nfour MAC infections, were observed within the first weeks of therapy (Hoffmann\\n1999). Lymph node abscesses usually occur during the first weeks of ART. IRIS cases\\nwith Mycobacterium xenopi or kansasii have also been described (Chen 2004, Phillips\\n2005).\\nThere are now numerous reports on tuberculosis (John 1998, Chien 1998), reminis-\\ncent of the “paradoxical” reactions to TB treatment known in the 1950s. All of these\\npatients suffered an initial deterioration while on correct tuberculostatic treatment\\nand ART-induced immune reconstitution. By the same token, meningitis as well as\\nOpportunistic Infections (OIs)    393'),\n",

Prednisolone\\nwas effective in a placebo-controlled trial (Meintjes 2010). \\nAn early or immediate start of ART in therapy-naïve patients facilitates the occur-\\nrance of IRIS. In large randomized trials the risk of IRIS increased when ART was\\nstarted immediately in patients with TB, especially in those with low CD4 T cells\\n(Abdool 2011, Blanc 2011, Havlir 2011, Wondvossen 2012, Naidoo 2013). In all\\nstudies, however, the increased risk did not lead to increased mortality. This may be\\ndifferent in patients with tuberculous meningitis, in which at least one randomized\\ntrial showed a less favorable outcome with early ART (Torok 2009). In cases of menin-\\ngitis, steroids should be given (Meintjes 2012).  \\nCMV IRIS. In addition to mycobacteriosis, numerous cases of unusual CMV infec-\\ntions under ART have been published. In patients with previously diagnosed CMV\\nretiniotis, IRIS developed in 38% (Müller 2010). Inflammatory CMV retinitis with\\nvitritis that may lead to visual impairment, papillitis and macular edema, can now\\nbe described as a distinct syndrome, differing significantly from the course of CMV\\nretinitis seen in the pre-HAART era (Jacobson 1997, Karavellas 1999). Neovascular -\\nization endangers vision even after resolution (Wright 2003). As with MAC disease,\\nin vitro studies have shown that the CMV-specific immune response is improved\\nmost significantly in those patients developing vitritis (Mutimer 2002, Stone 2002).\\nInflammatory CMV manifestations are not limited to the retina and may involve\\nother organs.\\nPML IRIS. The course of inflammatory PML that occurs during IRIS is different from\\nthe infaust prognosis seen during the pre-HAART era (Collazos 1999, Cinque 2001,\\nMiralles 2001). Clinical symptoms are often more fulminant initially, and on\\n radiology, there is a contrast enhancement which is otherwise atypical for PML, that\\nmay resolve over time. Patients have a better prognosis, and PML seems to resolve\\ncompletely (Hoffmann 2003, Du Pasquier 2003). It appears that a number of patients\\nwith inflammatory PML, who have been asymptomatic for years, live without any\\nresidual symptoms. However, fatal cases of inflammatory PML have also been\\nreported (Safdar 2002). Previously documented experiences indicate that steroids are\\nineffective, although there have been accounts of positive results (Nuttall 2004, Tan\\n2009).\\nCryptococcal IRIS. Numerous cases with inflammatory courses of disease have been\\ndescribed (Overview: Haddow 2010). Together with MAC/TBC and CMV , cryptococci\\nare probably the most influential pathogens that contribute to IRIS. In particular,\\nseverely immunocompromised patients who start with ART after cryptococcal\\ntherapy should be watched closely for the first few weeks and months. Deferring\\nART for five weeks after the diagnosis of meningitis may be associated with improved\\nsurvival (Boulware 2014). Studies show that 10–20% of patients with coinfection\\ndevelop a cryptococcal IRIS (Sungkanuparph 2009, Müller 2010). The MRI usually\\nshows choriomeningitis with significant enhancement in the choroid plexus.\\nCryptococcal antigen in the CSF is positive, although culture remains negative\\n(Boelaert 2004). The intracranial pressure is often particularly high (Shelbourne\\n2005). As well as meningitis, lymphadenitis can also occur (Skiest 2005).\\nIRIS induced by other infections. A large variety of case reports have been  published:\\nleishmaniasis (Jiménez-Expósito 1999), penicillosis (Ho 2010), histoplasmosis (De\\nLavaissiere 2008), pneumocystosis (Barry 2002, Koval 2002, Godoy 2008,\\nJagannathan 2009, Mori 2009), toxoplasmosis (Martin-Bondel 2011) or herpes\\n(Tobian 2014). Herpes zoster and hepatitis B or C episodes also seem to occur on\\nART, particularly during the first weeks (Behrens 2000, Chung 2002, Manegold 2001,\\n394 AIDS'),\n",

HHV-8-associated Kaposi’s sarcoma can worsen sig-\\nnificantly on ART in the presence of IRIS (Bower 2005, Leidner 2005, Feller 2008).\\nIncreasing dermatological problems such as exacerbation of pre-existing folliculitis\\nor skin disease have also been reported (Handa 2001, Lehloenyia 2006, Pereira 2007,\\nIarikov 2008). There are even reports about parvovirus and leprosy (Nolan 2003,\\nCouppie 2004, Bussone 2010, Watanabe 2011).\\nIRIS and other diseases. Diseases other than OIs are now recognized to occur as\\nIRIS. These include autoimmune diseases such as Graves’ disease, lupus, Sweet’s and\\nReiter’s syndromes, Guillain-Barré syndrome, acute porphyria, gout and sarcoidosis,\\nto name but a few (Bevilacqua 1999, Behrens 1998, Fox 1999, Gilquin 1998, Makela\\n2002, Mirmirani 1999, Neumann 2003, Piliero 2003, Sebeny 2010, Rasul 2011). Even\\ntwo cases of Peyronie’s disease, a fibrosis of the penis, were reported (Rogers 2004).\\nThese reports raise the question of whether all of these manifestations are truly\\ninduced by immune reconstitution or perhaps merely chance occurrences. While\\nmost reports initially offered little information on the etiology beyond purely hypo-\\nthetical discussions, it has recently become apparent that changes in the cytokine\\nprofile are involved in the pathogenesis of IRIS, together with an activation of the\\ncellular immune response. However, it seems that the mechanisms differ according\\nto disease and genetic profile (Price 2001, Shelbourne 2005).\\nConsequences\\nPatients starting ART with less than 200 CD4 T cells/µl and particularly those who\\nhave a high viral load require close clinical monitoring during the first weeks. Close\\nattention should be given especially in cases where very immunocompromised\\npatients suddenly feel physically “affected,” express subfebrile conditions, and want\\nto start ART “after thinking about it for a long time.” Latent infections are often\\npresent in such cases and rapidly become apparent as immune reconstitution occurs\\n– the poorer the immune status and the longer its duration, the greater the danger\\nof IRIS. Although newer studies prove that infection parameters such as CROP, D-\\ndimer or cytokines such as IL-6 or IP-7 are predictive of IRIS or OI (Rodger 2009,\\nAntonelli 2010, Porter 2010) it is not generally practiced in routine diagnosis. \\nHowever chest radiography, abdominal ultrasound and fundoscopy should be\\nincluded in routine investigations of such patients before beginning treatment.\\nMoreover, clinical examination which nowadays are often gladly overlooked should\\nbe taken seriously. Some authors suggest that MAC prophylaxis start even before\\nART in severely immunocompromised patients seems problematic, even though pro-\\nphylaxis cannot prevent MAC IRIS (Phillips 2002+2005). Still, prospective clinical\\nstudies have yet to prove whether administration of IL-2 or GM-CSF is worthwhile,\\nas was recently postulated (Pires 2005).\\nMycobacterioses in particular should be treated generously with steroids. This has\\nbeen confirmed in a randomized trial (Meintjes 2010). However, the beneficial effects\\nof steroids are not seen in viral IRIS (Meintjes 2012). \\nIn conclusion, one should always be prepared for atypical localizations, findings and\\ndisease courses of opportunistic infections. The prognosis of IRIS is usually good.\\nMortality of patients developing IRIS is reportedly not higher than that of patients\\nwithout IRIS (Park 2006).\\nReferences\\nAbdool Karim SS, Naidoo K, Grobler A, et al.

With thorough and competent work-up, a specific causative agent can\\nusually be found for wasting syndrome because it is essentially a classical exclusion\\ndiagnosis and really more of an epidemiological instrument than a specific disease.\\nAlthough previously a very frequent condition, wasting syndrome has become rare\\ntoday. For example, in a large study conducted in the year 2000, only 14% of patients\\nindicated having lost more than 10% of their original body weight (Wanke 2000).\\nRates are higher in intravenous drug users (Campa 2005). Weight loss remains an\\nindependent risk factor for mortality, even in the HAART era, and every patient\\nshould be weighed regularly. In one large study, mortality risk in patients with a loss\\ngreater than 10% of body weight was more than four to six times higher than that\\nof patients with stable body weight (Tang 2002). Patients with classic wasting\\n syndrome are often extremely weak and the risk for opportunistic infections is\\n significantly elevated (Dworkin 2003). There is also cognitive impairment in these\\npatients (Dolan 2003).\\nDiagnosis\\nThe causes of wasting syndrome are complex. First, it is necessary to exclude or treat\\nopportunistic infections (TB, MAC, cryptosporidiosis and microsporidiosis). If none\\nare found, then several reasons remain that may contribute, even in combination,\\nto wasting syndrome. These include: metabolic disorders, hypogonadism, poor nutri-\\ntion and malabsorption syndrome (Overview: Grinspoon 2003).\\nConsequently, a thorough patient history is extremely beneficial. Does the patient\\nhave a nutritional diet? How are meals distributed throughout the day? Is the patient\\ndepressed? Which drugs (ART) are being taken? Distinction from antiretroviral-\\ninduced lipoatrophy (d4T/ddI) is often difficult. Significant weight loss also occurs\\nfrequently on interferon (Garcia-Benayas 2002), but rapidly resolves after finishing\\ntreatment. In addition, hypogonadism should be ruled out with the measurement\\nof testosterone. While there are several simple tests for malabsorption syndromes, it\\nis prudent to start with testing albumin as well as TSH and cholesterol levels.\\nFurther tests such as D-xylose absorption or biopsies of the small intestine should\\nonly be initiated after consulting with a gastroenterologist. Other tests, such as DEXA,\\ndensitometry, bioelectrical impedance analysis, etc, should be conducted in centers\\nexperienced with AIDS wasting syndrome to determine the patient’s body compo-\\nsition.\\nTherapy\\nWasting syndrome always requires competent diet counseling. Exercise, if possible,\\nis also good. Of course, they only have limited success. Supportive parenteral nutri-\\ntion only helps if there are problems with absorption (Kotler 1990, Melchior 1996).\\nEffective ART, ideally without drugs that cause lipoatrophy such as d4T or ddI, and\\npossibly even omitting nucleoside analogs completely, is ideal. Severe lipoatrophy\\nmay require complete omission of nucleoside analogs (see Chapter on Nuke-sparing).\\nBeyond this, many kinds of drug treatment have been attempted. However, these\\nhave limited success and are often problematic.\\nMegestrol acetate, a synthetic gestagenic hormone, shows some benefit as an appetite\\nstimulant in wasting syndrome, as demonstrated in some studies (Von Roenn 1994,\\nOpportunistic Infections (OIs)    399'),\n",

Its side effects are those typically associated with steroids, includ-\\ning induced hypogonadism, which should always be avoided, especially in cases of\\nwasting syndrome. As a result, it is not widely nor currently recommended that this\\ndrug be used. \\nDronabinol, the main active ingredient in marijuana, has been licensed in the US\\nsince 1985 as Marinol\\n®, and may be prescribed for pharmacy formulation as drops\\nor hard gel capsules. This drug is certainly attractive for many patients and some-\\ntimes actively demanded. Prescription should be carefully considered, particularly\\nin view of the significant cost associated with the medication. In some European\\ncountries, dronabinol costs approximately 600 euros per month for the usual dose\\nof 5 mg TID. Without a clear diagnosis of wasting syndrome, communication with\\nthe insurance company may minimize substantial payment problems. Some health\\ninsurances and other payors reject the request. The effect on wasting syndrome is\\nmoderate at best, if detectable at all (Beal 1995). It tends to be even weaker than\\nmegestrol acetate (Timpone 1997).\\nHypogonadism, a frequent condition of patients with wasting syndrome, calls for\\nthe measurement of testosterone levels. If the age-dependent levels are low, then\\ntestosterone substitution has proven itselfuseful, both for weight gain and quality\\nof life (Grinspoon 1998). A dose of 250 mg testosterone is given IM every 3-4 weeks,\\nand there are a variety of less expensive generic names. The effect is sustained, even\\nwith long-term use (Grinspoon 1999). If testosterone levels are normal, substitution\\nis not indicated. In women, one should exercise caution when administering andro-\\ngenic hormones. Other anabolic steroids are available in addition to testosterone,\\nsuch as oxandrolone or nandrolone (Gold 2006, Sardar 2010). Although possibly\\nmore effective than testosterone, these drugs are commonly associated with other\\nside effects, particularly those related to the liver (Corcoran 1999). Positive effects\\nhave been demonstrated with the anabolic steroid oxymetholone in a small, double-\\nblind, randomized study (Hengge 2003). However, extremely high elevation of\\ntransaminases have been observed. \\nHigh costs and side effects have limited the use of recombinant human growth hor-\\nmones (rHGH), for which long-term data is still not available (Mulligan 1993,\\nSchambelan 1996). However, the results of a recent metaanalysis suggest that growth\\nhormones may be more effective than anabolic steroids or testosterone in wasting\\nsyndrome (Moyle 2004). Common adverse events with rHGH therapy include blood\\nglucose elevations, arthralgia, myalgia, and peripheral edema, but these usually\\nrespond to dose reduction or drug discontinuation (Review: Gelato 2007).\\nReferences \\nBeal JE, Olson R, Laubenstein L, et al.

In addition to affecting HIV+ patients more frequently than immunocompe-\\ntent individuals, these infections are also considered to have more severe courses of\\ndisease and more frequent recurrences in HIV+ patients than in HIV-negative\\npatients. Despite this, according to the current CDC/WHO classification, only histo-\\nplasmosis, isosporiasis, and coccidioidomycosis are AIDS-defining.\\nAspergillosis\\nAspergillosis occurs almost exclusively in severely immunocompromised patients\\nbut is not classified as AIDS-defining. In the largest cohort described worldwide to\\ndate, in a study of 342 cases of invasive aspergillosis, almost all of the patients had\\nless than 50 CD4 T cells/µl (Mylonakis 1998). Although the lungs are largely sus-\\nceptible to pneumonia or tracheobronchitis, almost all other organs can be com-\\npromised, particularly the CNS. Sinusitis or abcesses in kidney or liver are other man-\\nifestations (Hunt 2000, Myolonakis 2000).\\nFor the most part, aspergillosis occurs in HIV+ patients on long-term and in some\\ncases excessively long steroid treatment for another OI. Severe neutropenia\\n(<1000 leucocytes) is another risk factor. Found in over 90% of invasive aspergillo-\\nsis cases, Aspergillus fumigatus is by far the most frequent pathogen. Other important\\naspergillus pathogens are A. flavus, A. niger, A. terreus, and A. nidulans. The severely ill\\npatients complain of fever, cough, dyspnea and chest pain. Hemoptysis frequently occurs.\\nThe only way to reach a reliable diagnosis is biopsy. A serum antigen test on\\nGalactomannan, a component of the cell wall of Aspergillus (not exclusively, also\\nother mycoses) may support the diagnosis. Chest x-rays often remain inconspicu-\\nous. In the HRCT, bilateral, multifocal and nodular lesions may be the most common\\nradiological characteristic, while Halo and crescentic signs occur occasionally.\\nTreatment should be initiated immediately. Suspicion of aspergillosis justifies a treat-\\nment attempt without definitive diagnosis, i.e., biopsy results. Each delay worsens\\na potentially unfavorable prognosis substantially. At present voriconazole is consid-\\nered treatment of choice (Schwartz 2005). In contrast to other antifungal drugs,\\nvoriconazole penetrates well into the CNS. In patients with invasive aspergillosis,\\ninitial therapy with voriconazole led to better responses and improved survival and\\nresulted in fewer severe side effects than the standard approach of initial therapy\\nwith amphotericin B (Herbrecht 2002). Voriconazole is given at a dosage of 4 mg\\nIV/kg BID (loading dose: 6 mg/kg BID on day 1, oral therapy with 200 mg BID start-\\ning from day 7). Main adverse events are visual disturbances (20%) and (reversible)\\nincreases of liver enzymes. \\nAn alternative approach is amphotericin B, whose inferiority to voriconazole is ques-\\ntioned by some (Jorgensen 2006). The effect of combinations is not proven (Garbati\\n2012). Salvage therapy includes lipid-based formulations of amphotericin B, caspo-\\nfungin, high-dose itraconazole or posaconazole (Dockrell 2008). A systematic steroid\\ntherapy should be stopped if possible and every patient should receive antiretrovi-\\nral treatment immediately. Some case reports describe that permanent therapy can\\nbe dropped if immune reconstitution is sufficient (Yoganathan 2009). \\n402 AIDS'),\n",

Bacillary angiomatosis is caused by the rickettsial species Bartonella\\nhenselae and Bartonella quintana (“Rochalimaea” until the beginning of the 1990s).\\nWhile Bartonella henselae is typically associated with cats, its primary host, and cat\\nfleas, its vector; Bartonella quintana frequently affects homeless patients and is asso-\\nciated with poor hygiene and social-economic conditions. Several possible reservoirs\\nhave been discussed for such cases (Gasquet 1998). In a Spanish study of 340 HIV+\\npatients, 22% patients reacted to one or more Bartonella antigens. Of all the studied\\nseroprevalence factors, only age was statistically significant (Pons 2008). Reportedly,\\nBartonella occurs more often in North and South America than in Europe. In Brasil,\\nthe seroprevalence was 38% (Lamas 2010). In a study of 382 febrile HIV+ patients\\nin San Francisco, Bartonella was found to be the causative organism in 18% (Koehler\\n2003). \\nBacillary angiomatosis remains a significant differential diagnosis in all cases with\\nskin lesions of unknown etiology. The pseudoneoplastic, vascular skin proliferation\\nis quite often clinically and histologically mistaken for Kaposi’s sarcoma or heman-\\ngioma. The vascular nodules or tumors may be isolated, but are usually multiple and\\nreminiscent of fresh Kaposi’s sarcoma, with cherry red or purple nodules. One quarter\\nof the cases may have bone involvement with painful osteolytic foci (AP elevation).\\nHere, the skin lesions sometimes resemble dry hyperkeratotic changes such as those\\nseen in psoriasis. Different organs may be affected. In a collection of 21 cases,\\n19 patients had skin, 5 bone and 4 liver involvement (Plettenberg 2000). Mani -\\nfestations in lymph nodes, muscle, CNS, eye, gingiva and gastrointestinal tract have\\nalso been reported.\\nDiagnosis of BA is difficult. The gram-negative bacteria are only visible on biopsy\\nsamples stained with Warthin-Starry silver stain. If this stain method is not applied,\\nthen bacillary angiomatosis will not be found. Moreover, pathologists should be\\ninformed of the suspected diagnosis, as the Warthin-Starry silver stain is not  routinely\\nperformed. PCR is also possible. Reference labs should be contacted for further\\n diagnostic details.\\nTreatment of bacillary angiomatosis is with erythromycin (at least four weeks with\\n500 mg QID) or clarithromycin. Relapses are common, which is why some physi-\\ncians favor therapy for at least three months. Supposedly effective, doxycyclin is the\\nOpportunistic Infections (OIs)    403'),\n",

The Southern and Midwestern of  regions of the US as\\nwell as Central America and Africa are endemic areas. Even in the HAART era,\\n morbidity and mortality due to histoplasmosis remains a public heatlh problem in\\nlow-income and high-income countries (Review: Adenis 2014).\\nInhalation of microconidia, the spores of H. capsulatum, can cause granulomatous\\ndisease in the lungs of immunocompetent individuals. In HIV patients with impaired\\nimmunity (85% have less than 100 CD4 T cells/µl), infection leads to an acute, life-\\nthreatening disease with dry cough, fever, dyspnea and malaise (Gutierrez 2005, Mora\\n2008). Miliary TB and PCP are important differential diagnoses. Disseminated courses\\nof disease may also occur, in which the fungus can be detected in bone marrow or\\nby liver biopsy (Albrecht 1994). Skin ulcerations, oropharynx or CNS involvement\\nmay also occur (Scheinfeld 2003, Wheat 2005, Antonello 2011). Hepatosplenomegaly\\nis common, occurring in almost 90% of the patients (Mora 2008).\\nHistoplasmosis is an AIDS-defining illness whose pathogen like that of cryptococcal\\nantigen can be reliably detected in the blood with an antigen test. Laboratory eval-\\nuations often reveal significantly elevated LDH and alkaline phosphatase as well as\\ntransaminases. \\nAmphotericin B should be given as initial treatment. Liposomal amphotericin B\\n(3 mg/kg daily for 14 days) is not only less toxic, but possibly also more effective\\n(Johnson 2002). In milder cases, itraconazole (200 mg BID or TID) is effective, and\\ncan also be used as a secondary prophylaxis. It is significantly more effective than\\nfluconazole (Wheat 2002), but is associated with a high risk of interactions, partic-\\nularly with ritonavir, but also with efavirenz (Crommentuyn 2004, Andrade 2009,\\nHills-Nieminen 2009). In such cases a modification of the doses is often necessary.\\nWith regard to other OIs, secondary prophylaxis for histoplasmosis can be discon-\\ntinued if immune reconstitution is sufficient (Goldman 2004). Initiation of ART and\\nthe subsequent immune reconstitution may reveal undiagnosed latent disseminated\\nhistoplasmosis (Nacher 2006).\\n404 AIDS'),\n",

According to WHO, there are 12 million people infected with leish-\\nmania worldwide, with approximately 350 million living in risk areas. With such\\nnumbers, leishmaniasis is one of the most important parasitosis. In Europe, leish-\\nmaniasis is common and countries around the Mediterranean, such as Spain,\\nPortugal, France and Italy are affected the most. The following link provides a global\\noverview: www.who.int/leishmaniasis/leishmaniasis_maps/en/index.html. \\nVisceral leishmaniasis appears more frequently in HIV+ patients. In Spain, on third\\nof all patients with visceral leishmaniasis have HIV (Gil-Prieto 2011). While impor-\\ntant, leishmaniasis is still not an AIDS-defining illness. A review of 15 cases in\\nGermany showed that all HIV patients were significantly immunosuppressed (usually\\nless than 100 CD4 T cells/µl). A few patients had not been in endemic areas for\\nseveral years (Albrecht 1998). Bone marrow involvement is reflected by the almost\\nobligatory pancytopenia, which may be particularly severe in HIV patients (Pintado\\n2001). Other symptoms include fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and mucocutaneous\\nlesions. The diagnosis is usually made from bone marrow aspirate.\\nTreatment of visceral leishmaniasis is difficult (Review: Olliaro 2005). Pentavalent\\nantimony compounds such as sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam\\n®) or or meglumine\\nantimoniate (Glucantime®) have been used for about 60 years (usual dosage: 20 mg/kg\\nIV or IM daily for 28 days). However, these drugs are extremely toxic. Myalgia, arthral-\\ngia, cardiotoxicity and chemical pancreatitis often lead to discontinuation (Laguna\\n1999). Combination therapies are possibly more effective and allow for shorter\\ntherapy (van Griensven 2010, Sundar 2011).\\nAccording to a recent meta-analysis, available evidence suggests that amphotericin\\nis superior to antimony treatment in HIV+ patients (Cota 2013). Many guidelines\\nrecommend liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome\\n®) as the treatment of choice \\n(2–5 mg/kg daily). However, recent trials have suggested that effectiveness of lipo-\\nsomal amphotericin is limited in HIV-coinfected patients (Rijtmeier 2011, Sinha\\n2011). Classic amphotericin B is also effective (Lachaud 2009). \\nThe only orally bioavailable leishmaniasis drug and a promising new drug, due to\\nits good tolerability and efficacy, is miltefosine (Impavido\\n®), an alkylphosphocholine\\nanalog that was licensed in Europe in 2004. Although clarity is still needed as to how\\nmiltefosine inhibits leishmania metabolism, a Phase III study in India demonstrated\\nit as highly effective (Sundar 2002). Another randomized study in Ethiopia showed\\nthat among HIV+ patients with leishmaniasis, miltefosine was less effective than\\nsodium stibogluconate, but tolerability was better (Ritmeijer 2006). The dose was\\n100 mg daily (~2300 euros/month). We have successfully treated some patients with\\nmiltefosine to date. Another option may be paromomycin, an aminoglycoside which\\nseems to be effective as at least two randomized studies from India have shown\\n(Sundar 2007+2011). In Europe paramomycin (Humatin\\n®) has so far only been\\nlicensed as a gastrointestinal drug for local use. \\nAs a secondary prophylaxis pentamidine may be effective (Patel 2009). In contrast,\\nfluconazole seems to show no effects (Rybniker 2009). Relapses are frequent and\\noccur in almost half of all cases. ART seems to change this – another argument for\\ninclusion in the AIDS classification (de La Rosa 2002, Fernandez-Cotarelo 2003).\\nInterestingly, in vitro studies have consistently documented an inhibitory effect of\\nprotease inhibitors on leishmania parasites (van Griensven 2013). \\nOpportunistic Infections (OIs)    407'),\n",

At least four genera, with Enterocytozoon bieneusi\\nconsidered the most noteworthy, are described as pathogenic in humans. \\nEven in Germany, microsporidia were previously among the most recurrent diar-\\nrhea-causing microbes. Furthermore, in the pre-HAART era, microsporidia could be\\nfound in approximately one-third of all patients. Some studies documented up to\\ntwo-thirds of all HIV+ patients with chronic diarrhea (Sobottka 1998). The incidence\\nof microsporidiosis has been reduced significantly due to ART; consequently, it is\\nnow only diagnosed occasionally. Although microsporidiosis is not AIDS-defining,\\nchronic microsporidiosis almost always occurs in severely immunocompromised\\npatients with CD4 T cell counts of less than 50 cells/µl. \\nDiarrhea may be very severe; watery, though not bloody; and accompanied by\\nabdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Fever is almost always absent. While myosi-\\ntis, keratoconjunctivitis and sinusitis have rarely been described, infections of the\\nbiliary ducts are considered common.\\nIn light of the fact that microsporidia, like cryptosporidia, are very small, an expe-\\nrienced lab is desirable for detection.

Kaposi’s Sarcoma\\nCHRISTIAN HOFFMANN, STEFAN ESSER\\nKaposi’s sarcoma (KS) is the most common malignancy in patients with HIV infec-\\ntion. In 1981, the simultaneous occurrence of KS with pneumocystis pneumonias\\nin young gay men led to the first descriptions of AIDS. This entity is designated after\\nthe Hungarian dermatologist Moritz Kaposi who first described the “classical” KS\\n100 years earlier. Classical KS predominantly occurs in elderly, but otherwise healthy\\npeople from the Eastern Mediterranean area. It affects often only the skin at the\\nlower extremities and thereby, clearly differs from HIV-associated KS which will be\\nthe focus of the following chapter.\\nIn contrast to classical KS, HIV-associated KS may affect all skin and mucous mem-\\nbranes. Lymph nodes and internal organs such as stomach, gut, lung or liver may\\nalso be involved. The progression of HIV-associated KS is very variable and reaches\\nfrom small lesions, remaining stable for years, to extremely aggressive courses, in\\nwhich progression may lead to death within a few months. \\nCompared to the 1980s and early 1990s, when KS was one of the most common\\nAIDS illnesses, prevalence of KS today is relatively low (Francesci 2010) and the inci-\\ndence has fallen to less than a tenth of what it was (Grabar 2006, Simard 2011). In\\naddition, the clinical course of KS has changed. The refractory variants with an aggres-\\nsive, devastating and often fatal course which were seen in the pre-HAART era have\\nbecome a rarity today. However, mortality of KS patients remains elevated even after\\ninitiation of ART, especially during the first year (Maskew 2013). Moreover, there are\\nstill some very aggressive cases occurring today, typically only a few weeks or months\\nafter ART initiation. This so-called IRIS-associated KS often comes with rapid visceral\\nlesions and high mortality (Crane 2005, Achenbach 2012, Letang 2013). High HHV-8\\nand HIV viremia seem to be risk factors for this IRIS-associated KS (Letang 2013).\\nPathogenesis \\nThe cellular origin of the spindle cells (considered the KS tumor cells) is still\\n controversial. Newer investigations suggest lymphatic, endothelial cells (Dupin\\n2006). Since 1994, it is well known that KS is induced by an infection with the human\\nherpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) or Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). HHV-8\\ncan be always detected in the tumor tissue, and the level of HHV-8 plasma viremia\\ncorrelates quite well with KS progression (Laney 2007). In HIV+ patients with KS, a\\nsignificant HHV-8 viremia is frequently found (Marshall 2010). Transmission of HHV-\\n8 occurs predominantly via saliva (Pauk 2000), but also sexually, vertically and via\\nblood products (Pica 2008). In some regions, particularly in Italy and Central Africa,\\nHHV-8 can be found in up to 50% of the general population. The exact role of HHV-\\n8 in the pathogenesis of KS is not clear. However, HHV-8 is able to exploit the normal\\ndifferentiation pathway of endothelial cells (EC). Through manipulation of EC-\\nspecific transcriptional regulators this may contribute to viral persistence and KS\\n sarcomagenesis (Review: Cancian 2013).\\nInfection with HHV-8 does not lead inevitably to KS. Interactions particularly with\\nHIV-1 (Aoki 2004), possibly also with other viruses such as HHV-6 and HSV-1,\\nchanged signal transduction chains, an increased production of growth factors as\\nwell as cytokine dysregulation, all may play a role (McCormack 2005).\\nAmong the HIV+ population, gay men are almost the only ones affected by KS; in\\nHIV+ women, children or hemophiliacs, KS is a rare disease. An immune defect\\nand/or low CD4 T cells promote emergence and growth of KS. However, severe\\n412'),\n",

In one study, the activation of the CD8 T cells\\n correlated more strongly with the progression than the number of CD4 T cells\\n(Stebbing 2006). Interestingly, some cohorts with HIV-negative MSM developing KS\\nhave been reported (Rashidghamat 2014).\\nSigns, symptoms and diagnosis\\nHIV-associated KS does not have a preferential pattern of localization. It can begin\\non any area of the skin, but may also appear on oral, genital, or ocular mucous mem-\\nbranes. Typical findings at manifestation are a few asymptomatic purple macules or\\nnodules. These lesions have a predilection for distribution along relaxed skin tension\\nlines. As mentioned above, the disease progression is very variable: the tumors can\\nremain unchanged for months to years, or grow rapidly within a few weeks and\\n disseminate. Rapid growth can lead to localized pain and a yellow-green discoloration\\nof the area around the tumor as a result of hemorrhage. Further progression of the\\ntumor can lead to central necrosis and ulceration. The tumors may bleed easily.\\nPlaque-like and nodular KS lesions often become confluent and can be accompanied\\nby massive lymphoedema. In the oral cavity, the hard palate is frequently affected.\\nLesions begin with purplish erythema and progress to plaques and nodules that\\n ulcerate easily. KS lesions may also involve the external genitalia including the\\n foreskin and glans penis.\\nRegression of KS during treatment is not only indicated by reduction of the size of\\nthe lesions but also by change in color from dark to bright red. However, some lesions\\nmay persist lifelong. These often dirty-grey-brown to light brown hyperpigmenta-\\ntions are caused by hemosiderin deposits and, possibly, increased stimulation of\\nmelanocytes due to inflammation. Lymphoedema can also persist for years. \\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of cutaneous KS is usually made based on clinical findings. However, in\\nall questionable cases a histologic diagnosis is recommended. Differential diagnosis\\nincludes other neoplasia such as cutaneous lymphomas or angiosarcoma, but also\\ninfectious diseases such as syphilis and bacillary angiomatosis. Histological findings\\ninclude spindle-shaped cells with vascular channels lined by abnormal endothelial\\ncells. Extravasated erythrocytes, hemosiderin, and fibrosis can often be seen. \\nIn all cases of KS, clinical staging procedures are recommended, including:\\n1. Complete inspection (oral and genital mucous membranes!)\\n2. Abdominal ultrasound\\n3. Gastroduodenoscopy and colposcopy (both procedures obligatory when mucous\\nmembranes are involved)\\n4. Chest radiography (exclusion of a pulmonary KS) \\nTreatment\\nIf KS is newly diagnosed in an HIV+ patient naïve to antiretroviral therapy, ART\\nshould be initiated: in early KS, additional chemotherapy is only required in 20% of\\ncases (Bower 2009).

Among 213 ART-naïve patients with early KS stages who were\\ntreated with ART alone, overall survival at five years was 95%, while progression-free\\nsurvival was 77% (Bower 2014). In one Italian study in 22 ART-naïve KS patients,\\nthe overall clinical response rate to ART alone was 91%: 18 complete and 2 partial\\nresponses were achieved, and only two patients experienced disease progression.\\nComplete remission was sustained in all 18 patients with complete response (Cattelan\\n2005). \\nAnimal and in vitro experiments have suggested a direct anti-proliferative effect of\\nPIs (Sgadari 2002, Gantt 2011). There is some evidence that PIs may reduce oral\\n shedding of HHV-8 (Gantt 2014) and that KS incidence is reduced with longer PI use\\n(Kowalkowski 2015). However, there is no ART combination of choice for KS patients.\\nPIs are not required necessarily as NNRTI-based regimens are also effective with regard\\nto KS regression (Grabar 2006, Martinez 2006). \\nWith ART, there is also an improvement of the humoral response against HHV-8\\n(Sullivan 2010) and HHV-8 viremia rapidly decreases (Cattamanchi 2011). ART inter-\\nruptions should be avoided in patients with current or previous KS. In the SMART\\nstudy, KS was among the most frequent AIDS-defining illnesses during treatment\\ninterruptions, in particular among patients with a history of KS (Silverberg 2007). \\nART as the only therapy is not recommended in all cases. In patients with rapidly\\nprogressive disease (especially in the setting of IRIS), with KS-related symptoms, or\\nwith visceral disease or lymphoedema, ART should be combined with cytotoxic\\nchemotherapy (Grabar 2006). There are different options:\\nChemotherapy: Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride (Caelyx\\n® or Doxil®)\\nat a dosage of 20 mg/m² body surface is the treatment of choice (Di Trolio 2006).\\nWith Caelyx\\n® complete remission rates of up to 80% are possible (Lichterfeld 2005).\\nThe infusions for 30–60 min. every 2–3 weeks are feasible on an outpatient basis and\\nusually well tolerated. An antiemetic therapy is not necessary. Usually 6-8 cycles are\\nrequired to achieve a good clinical response. Relapses during Caelyx\\n® therapy occur\\nrarely and particularly during the first year (Martin-Carbonero 2008). During treat-\\nment, myelotoxicity and cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin should be considered.\\nAlthough the latter is rare and occurs only above cumulative doses of 450 mg,\\nechocardiography (ejection fraction?) is recommend at the beginning of therapy as\\nwell as controls after six cycles. Another important side effect of Caelyx\\n® is palmo-\\nplantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE, “hand-foot-syndrome”), which becomes apparent\\nas painful erythemas at hands and feet (Lorusso 2007). \\nIn August 2011, Janssen-Cilag reported a shortage of Caelyx\\n® (Doxil®) due to pro-\\nduction delays at a contract manufacturer. Intermittent capacity constraints were\\nseen during the following months. In the setting of this shortage, liposomal daunoru-\\nbicine (DaunoXome\\n®) is an alternative. However, DaunoXome ® appears to be less\\neffective than Caelyx ® (Cooley 2007). Of note, non-liposomal and non-pegylated\\nforms of doxorubicin are not bioequivalent.\\nBeside doxorubicin and daunorubicin, paclitaxel (Taxol\\n®) is also effective in KS\\n(Tulpule 2002, Dhillon 2005, Stebbing 2006, Cianfrocca 2010). However, paclitaxel\\nis more myelotoxic and leads almost always to complete alopecia, often during the\\nvery first cycle (patients must be informed!). Paclitaxel should be used only if KS\\nlesions show progression during therapy with Caelyx\\n® or when Caelyx ® or\\nDaunoXome® are not available. Docetaxel (Taxotere®) is also effective according to\\nuncontrolled studies (Autier 2005, Lim 2005). It should be mentioned that signifi-\\ncant interactions may exist between the taxanes and ART. Paclitaxel levels may\\nincrease significantly when combined with PIs (Bundow 2004, Cianfrocca 2011). \\n414 AIDS'),\n",

The effect mechanism of IFN on KS is not fully clarified. Apart from\\nan immune modulating effect, IFN probably induces the apoptosis in KS cells. It is\\nimportant to note that the effectiveness depends on the immune status. In patients\\nwith more than 400 CD4 T cells/µl, remission rates during IFN are at least 45%, com-\\npared with only 7% in patients with less than 200 CD4 T cells/µl.

Compressive therapy with elastic stockings is an important strategy for the\\ntreatment of KS associated lymphoedema (Brambilla 2006). \\nKS is a strikingly radiosensitive tumor (Becker 2006, Donato 2013). Superficial\\nmacular or plaque-like KS lesions respond well to daily doses of 4–5 Gy (total dose\\n20–30 Gy, fractionated 3x/week) of soft x-ray radiation. In the case of large KS lesions\\nwith edema, radiation with fast electron beams (5 x 2 Gy per week, total dose 40 Gy)\\nis recommended.\\nAs KS is a multifocal systemic disease, surgical treatment is limited to excisional biop-\\nsies for diagnosis and palliative removal of small tumors in cosmetically disturbing\\nareas. Since tumors often extend further into the surroundings than is clinically\\nvisible and local trauma can lead to new tumors (Koebner phenomenon), local and\\nregional recurrences can be expected. These can be prevented by radiation therapy:\\nin order to reach the tumor cells spreading along the vascular channels, the field of\\nradiation should be extended 0.5-1.0 cm beyond the edges of the tumor. \\nNew therapeutic approaches : With regards to the KS pathogenesis, several new\\n therapies have been suggested such as virustatic agents, cytokines and inhibitors of\\nangiogenesis. They are described here briefly: \\n\\x81 Valganciclovir –a promising approach; this antiviral agent significantly reduces\\nHHV-8 replication, shown in a randomized trial (Casper 2008). Antiviral efficacy\\nis higher than with valacyclovir or famciclovir (Cattamanchi 2011). However, there\\nare no data on clinical efficacy in AIDS-related KS published to date. As HHV-8 is\\ninvolved in the early steps of KS pathogenesis, it is questionable if valganciclovir\\nhas any effect on manifest lesions. In patients with classical KS, the drug remained\\ninefficient (Krown 2011).\\n\\x81 Interleukin-12 – high response rates in a Phase II study, in which this cytokine was\\ncombined with liposomal doxorubicin (Little 2007). No randomized studies. \\n\\x81 Sirolimus (and everolimus) – new immunosuppressive agents used in the transplant\\nand rare diseases (tuberous sclerosis, LAM) settings. Good response rates in uncon-\\ntrolled studies on HIV-negative renal transplant recipients with KS (Stallone 2005,\\nCampistol 2007). It is postulated that these drugs inhibit tumour angiogenesis\\nthrough impaired vascular endothelium growth factor production. \\n\\x81 Lenalidomide – immunomodulatory drug with antiangiogenic effects, encourag-\\ning case reports, an ongoing US Phase I/II trial to evaluate the efficacy and toler-\\nance of lenalidomide in HIV-related KS with and without visceral involvement\\n(Martinez 2011, Steff 2013). \\n\\x81 Bevacizumab – an early study of this VEGF antibody showed moderate response\\nrates in 31% of 17 HIV+ patients with KS progression on ART (Uldrick 2010). A\\nstudy of combination with liposomal doxorubicine is ongoing.\\n\\x81 Imatinib (Glivec\\n®) – activation of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and \\nc-Kit receptors has been proposed as important in mediating the growth of AIDS-\\nrelated KS. In a Phase II study, treatment with imatinib mesylate yielded to partial\\nregression in 33% of AIDS/KS cases (Koon 2013).\\n\\x81 Sorafenib (Nexavar\\n®) – an oral Raf kinase inhibitor, approved for advanced renal\\ncancer. Case reports on KS (Ardavanis 2008). Phase I studies are underway. \\n\\x81 Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) – are involved in tumour metastasis and are\\nover-expressed in KS cells. MMP inhibitors such as COL-3 have shown activity in\\na Phase II study on patients with advanced KS (Dezube 2006). However, clinical\\nresponse rates were at best moderate. The most common adverse events were\\n photosensitivity and rash.

Malignant Lymphomas\\nCHRISTIAN HOFFMANN\\nMalignant lymphomas are neoplastic diseases of the lymphatic system that grow\\nrapidly and aggressively, and lead to death within a few weeks or months if left\\nuntreated. Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is distinguished from the large group of non-\\nHodgkin lymphomas (NHL). In comparison to the general population, HIV+ patients\\nare affected significantly more frequently by all types of lymphoma. Aggressive non-\\nHodgkin lymphomas of B cell origin are particularly frequent. The incidence of\\n lymphomas has been markedly reduced by the introduction of antiretroviral therapy.\\nNonetheless, risk remains greatly elevated relative to the general population (Gibson\\n2014, Table 1) and there is evidence that this reduction overall was not as impres-\\nsive as with KS or most other opportunistic infections (COHERE 2009, Franceschi\\n2010). Thus, the relative proportion of lymphoma among all AIDS-associated ill-\\nnesses is increasing. The decline of incidence seems to be greater for lymphoma sub-\\ntypes that mainly occur in severe immunodeficiency (Kirk 2001, Polesel 2008). \\nIn some HIV cohorts, malignant lymphomas have already overtaken KS as the most\\nfrequent malignancy. In the EuroSIDA study, the proportion of AIDS-defined illnesses\\nthat were malignant lymphomas increased from less than 4% in 1994 to 16% in\\n1998 (Mocroft 2000). Among the AIDS-related deaths, lymphoma is by far the most\\nfrequent disease involved. In France, lymphomas accounted for 24% of all AIDS-\\nrelated deaths in HIV patients (Morlat 2012). \\nTable 1: Relative risk of different lymphomas in HIV+ patients in comparison to a non-HIV+\\npopulation in the HAART era (adapted from Gibson 2014)\\nOverall NHL 10.6 \\nDiffuse Large B cell lymphoma 17.6\\nBurkitt NHL 33.7\\nNot classifiable 19.9\\nPrimary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) 47.7\\nLow-grade Non-AIDS-defining NHL \\nFollicular 1.3\\nPeripheral T cell 3.6\\nMalignant lymphomas in HIV+ patients are also biologically very heterogeneous and\\ndiffer in several aspects. The frequency and extent of oncogenic mutations or\\ncytokine dysregulation differ, as does the histogenetic origin of the malignant cells\\n(Porcu 2000). In addition, the association with EBV and other oncogenic viruses such\\nas HHV-8 or SV40 is very variable. The extent of immunodeficiency also varies\\n significantly. Burkitt’s lymphoma and Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) frequently occur\\neven when immune status is good. In contrast, immunoblastic and especially primary\\nCNS lymphoma (PCNSL) are almost always associated with severe immunodefi-\\nciency. There is now some evidence that some subtypes of malignant lymphoma can\\nbe considered to be “opportunistic” as severe immunodeficiency is required for the\\ndevelopment of these entities. For other lymphoma subtypes, chronic B cell activa-\\ntion, possibly induced by even low HIV viremia, is a prerequisite (Epeldegui 2007,\\nZoufaly 2009, Regidor 2011). \\nHowever, HIV-associated lymphomas – both NHL and HL – have numerous common\\nclinical features. Characteristics include the usually aggressive growth, diagnosis in\\nthe advanced stages with frequent extranodal manifestations, poorer response to\\n420'),\n",

Despite\\na better prognosis during recent years (see below), HIV+ patients with NHL continue\\nto endure substantially higher mortality compared with HIV-uninfected patients with\\nNHL (Chao 2010).\\nThe treatment of malignant lymphoma remains problematic. Although aggressive\\nchemotherapy is possible in many patients with existing immunodeficiency, it is\\ncomplicated and requires a close cooperation between HIV clinicians and physicians\\nwith experience in hematology/oncology.\\nWe discuss systemic NHL, PCNSL and HL separately; multicentric Castleman’s disease\\nwill also be mentioned as a distinct entity, although it is not considered a malignant\\nlymphoma. Low-grade (indolent) NHLs are very rare in HIV+ patients, and will there-\\nfore not be discussed here. As there are no recommendations available, the treat-\\nment of such cases should follow the recommendations for HIV-negative patients.\\nSystemic non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) \\nA close association between systemic NHL and AIDS has been described for a long\\ntime – the first cases were published only about a year after the first description of\\nAIDS and even before the discovery of HIV (Ziegler 1982). High-grade BNHLs have\\nbeen AIDS-defining since 1985.\\nMore than 90% of HIV-associated NHLs are of B cell origin. They are almost always\\nof high-grade malignancy. Two main histological types dominate: according to the\\nWHO classification, these are Burkitt’s lymphomas, which comprise 30–40% of cases,\\nand diffuse large-cell B cell lymphomas, comprising 40–60%. However, a relatively\\nlarge proportion of HIV-associated lymphomas (up to 30%) cannot be classified even\\nby reference laboratories. A small proportion of NHLs (1-3%) are primary effusion\\nor body cavity-based lymphomas and are considered a distinct entity (see below).\\nThe prognosis of patients with NHL was poor in the pre-HAART era, being between\\n6 and 9 months (Levine 2000). Due to the introduction of combination that com-\\npared the variable impact on mortality of AIDS-defining events diagnosed during\\ncombination antiretroviral therapy, NHL was the AIDS-defining event with the great-\\nest mortality hazard ratio (ART-CC 2009). Whether the clinical and pathological spec-\\ntrum of lymphoma subtypes is also changing remains unclear. A French study showed\\nno differences in lymphoma features in antiretrovirally treated patients compared\\nto treatment-naïve patients (Gérard 2009). However, it seems possible that, com-\\npared to HL or Burkitt’s lymphoma, the percentage of “opportunistic” NHL such as\\nimmunoblastic lymphoma will decrease.\\nPrevention and early detection\\nThere is no data supporting specific therapies or diagnostic procedures (such as peri-\\nodical ultrasound controls, etc) for prevention or for early detection of malignant\\nlymphomas. Antiretroviral therapy seems to be the best protection against lym-\\nphoma. ART not only improves the immune status but it also reduces the chronic\\nB cell stimulation, another risk factor for the development of lymphoma (Grulich\\n2008). HIV plasma viremia should be as low as possible as cumulative HIV viremia\\nis an independent and strong predictor of AIDS-related lymphoma among patients\\nreceiving ART (Zoufaly 2009). Blood EBV DNA load also represents a risk factor\\n(Leruez-Ville 2012). \\nBesides ART, there have been numerous studies evaluating factors (so called “bio-\\nmarkers”) that may precede the development of AIDS-associated lymphoma. For\\nexample, it has been shown that the levels of serum globulins (Grulich 2000), inter-\\nMalignant Lymphomas 421'),\n",

These\\n findings may help us understand the pathogenesis of lymphomas in HIV+ patients.\\nHowever, a routine diagnostics measure has not been found. \\nSigns and symptoms\\nThe main symptom is lymph node enlargement. Lymphomas are firm, immobile or\\nbarely mobile and painless. A large proportion of patients have advanced-stage\\n lymphoma at the time of diagnosis. Ann Arbor stages III-IV are almost always the\\nrule, and B symptoms with fever, night sweats and/or weight loss are found in the\\nmajority of cases (60–80%). General asthenia, significant malaise and rapid physical\\ndeterioration are also frequently seen. Extra-nodal involvement is common, and may\\nbe to a grotesque extent. In our own cohort of 203 patients, 81% had at least one\\nextra-nodal focus (Hoffmann 2003). Every conceivable region of the body can be\\naffected—the orbital cavity, testes, heart, breasts, bladder, kidneys, muscles, bones,\\netc. The gastrointestinal tract, liver, and bone marrow are affected particularly\\n frequently. Secondary CNS involvement can also occur. With extra-nodal disease,\\nadditional symptoms arise depending on the localization. These include, for example,\\nabdominal pain from hepatosplenomegaly, hemorrhage or ileus symptoms due to\\nintestinal involvement, bone pain with skeletal infiltration, or headache caused by\\nbrain disease.\\nDiagnosis\\nRapid histological diagnosis is essential. If bone marrow biopsy cannot secure the\\ndiagnosis, then a lymph node (e.g., cervical, axillary or inguinal) should be extir-\\npated. Mere puncture biopsy of a lymph node is often not sufficient to secure a rep-\\nresentative specimen. It is imperative to send the material to a specialized pathol-\\nogy laboratory with extensive experience in lymph node morphology. Every case\\nshould be discussed with the pathologist and caution taken to avoid a misdiagno-\\nsis. A typical yet mostly wrong diagnosis is that of a high- or low-grade T cell lym-\\nphoma in an AIDS patient. T cell lymphomas are very rare in AIDS patients and in\\nmost cases, T cell infiltrates indicate several infectious diseases like malignant syphilis\\nrather than lymphoma. \\nThe basic pathological diagnosis should include information about the subtype of\\nlymphoma (Burkitt?), the proliferation rate and the expression profile (definitely\\nCD20, and probably CD10, CD138, MUM-1) as these can influence the therapy (see\\nbelow). All patients with suspected NHL should be staged according to the Ann Arbor\\nclassification (Tables 2a, b).\\nBasic diagnostic tests for staging include chest radiography; abdominal ultrasound;\\nCT scans of the neck, thorax and abdomen; and bone marrow biopsy; aspiration\\nalone is not enough. In addition to an updated immune status and viral load, the\\nfollowing should be determined at the very least: blood count, ESR, CRP, uric acid,\\nLDH, liver and kidney parameters and electrolytes.

In addition to the\\nchemotherapy, all patients also received G-CSF, a co-trimoxazole prophylaxis and an\\nAZT-free ART. Both groups were well matched. The planned CHOP cycles were carried\\nout at the same intensity in both groups.\\nThe main results were disappointing. There was only a trend towards a better response\\nin the R-CHOP arm (complete response rate 58% versus 47%, p=0.15). No differences\\nwere found with respect to the length of response, disease-free or total survival.\\nHowever, neutropenia and incidence of (especially severe) infection were signifi-\\ncantly higher in the rituximab group. Out of a total of 15 patients who died from\\nan infection during the study, 14 had received rituximab (14% versus 2%, p=0.035).\\nThe cause of death was usually septicemia from various bacteria – both gram-nega-\\ntive and gram-positive were identified. Death occurred in the majority (8/15) during\\nthe first two cycles, although six cases happened during the rituximab treatment at\\nthe end of the chemotherapy. Fatalities occurred in all centers and were therefore\\nnot due to a possible lack of expertise in any one location. A further risk factor for\\n“death from infection” was a low baseline CD4 count – 8/13 patients had less than\\n50 CD4 T cells/µl. The cause of the high rate of severe infections is still unclear.\\nPathophysiologically, it is at least possible that in pre-existing T cell defects present\\nin HIV+ patients, a long-lasting rituximab-induced B cell depletion or hypoglobu-\\nlinemia has particularly negative effects (Miles 2005). \\nThere are also some case reports on HIV-negative patients developing PML after\\n rituximab (Carson 2009), raising concerns about an additive or even exponential\\nrisk for PML in HIV+ patients exposed to rituximab. However, up to now, our pre-\\nliminary data suggest no evidence for an early excess incidence of PML in HIV+\\npatients treated with rituximab (Hoffmann 2012).\\nIn contrast to the results of AMC 010, there are numerous mostly uncontrolled studies\\nwhich did not find an elevated risk for serious infection with the use of rituximab\\n(Spina 2005, Boue 2006, Ribera 2008, Sparano 2009). In our own prospective cohort\\nstudy of 164 patients with NHL since 2005, treatment with rituximab was beneficial\\neven in severely immunosuppressed patients (Wyen 2012). Moreover, we did not\\nfind evidence for a high incidence of PML (Hoffmann 2012). Recent meta-analyses\\nshow a moderate benefit with regard to CR rates and survival for HIV+ patients\\ntreated with rituximab (Castillo 2012, Barta 2013).\\nFollowing the current data, the use of rituximab can be considered in all HIV+ patients\\nwith CD20-positive NHL. Even a severe immune deficiency (less than 200 CD4 \\nT cells/µl) is not a contraindication. However, intensive monitoring and the\\n prophylactic use of co-trimoxazole (and possibly quinolones) may be advisable. In\\naddition, it is imperative that more data is obtained. \\nMore intensive chemotherapy as standard CHOP\\nAfter earlier studies showed that intensive chemotherapy led to a disproportionately\\nhigh risk of infection and toxic complications (Kaplan 1997), the tendency for a long\\ntime was to withhold HIV+ patients from therapy and often to treat them with\\nreduced-dose regimens.

In addition, CDE, a\\nregimen which, when given for several days as infusion is supposed to overcome the\\npotential chemotherapy resistance of lymphoma cells, is propagated again and again\\n(Sparano 2004, Spina 2005). This is also the case for the EPOCH regimen (Little 2003,\\nBarta 2012). The CR rates in these studies were between 50 and 75%. In our experi-\\nence, CR rates up to 70% are also possible with ART and standard CHOP. Whether\\nthese new attempts, which always cause a stir, are really better than CHOP, remains\\nspeculative. In our view, they are not ready for use outside of trials. \\nEven stem cell transplantations are now possible in HIV+ patients – a scenario that\\nwas unthinkable just a few years ago. Very high doses of myeloablative chemother-\\napy in combination with ART are well tolerated (see below). In patients with Burkitt’s\\nlymphoma, intensive protocols that were originally developed for HIV-negative\\npatients are also being successfully employed (see below). Today, the decisive ques-\\ntion regarding more intensive chemotherapy in HIV+ patients is, therefore, not\\nwhether it can be used, but who actually needs it or will benefit from an increased dose.\\nWhat ART when?\\nIn early studies, the effect of combination ART on the prognosis of HIV-associated\\nNHL was only modest (Levine 2000). However, many studies clearly demonstrated\\nthat prognosis of patients with NHL is markedly improved with ART (Antinori 2001,\\nBesson 2001, Ratner 2001, Hoffmann 2003). In addition to survival, some studies\\nalso showed improved disease-free survival, response rates and even improved\\n tolerability of chemotherapy. Even cases in which ART alone led to a complete remis-\\nsion of lymphoma have been published (Amengual 2008, Baraboutis 2009, Teng\\n2011). There is no doubt that every patient with AIDS-associated lymphoma should\\nstart an antiretroviral therapy, even in the setting of a relatively preserved immune\\nfunction.\\nIn most cases, an already existing, virologically effective ART can be continued during\\nchemotherapy. However, a switch from AZT (myelotoxic) and from d4T/ddI (high\\nrisk of polyneuropathy, in particular when given with vinca alkaloids) to other\\n nucleoside analogs or to a nuke-free regimen should be considered. Before switch-\\ning to abacavir, an HLA-B*5701 genetic screening is recommended. When switch-\\ning to tenofovir, intensive monitoring of renal function parameters is required.   \\nIn naïve patients, the first one or two CHOP cycles can be completed before start-\\ning ART. Some clinicians prefer to complete all six cycles out of concern for inter-\\nactions and cumulative toxicities (Little 2003). In our opinion, this is not necessary,\\neven though data on possible interactions between ART and chemotherapy is limited\\n(Review: Mounier 2008). For example, the effect of PIs and NNRTIs on doxorubicin\\nlevels seems to be only moderate (Toffoli 2004) and in many studies, the concomi-\\ntant use of ART and chemotherapy was feasible and safe (Powles 2002, Weiss 2006,\\nSimcock 2007, Bower 2008). However, there have been some reports of patients who\\nexperienced severe vinblastine-associated neurotoxicity during concomitant treat-\\nment with ritonavir-boosted PIs (Cheung 2010). If PI-containing combinations are\\nused, TDM is recommended. However, due several reports on an enhanced toxicity\\nrisk with PIs (Levêque 2009, Cingolani 2011, Corona 2013, Ezzat 2013), we would\\nrecommend avoiding PI-based regimens in patients receiving chemotherapy. \\nThus, in ART-naïve patients without pre-existing renal damage, we would favor a\\ncombination of tenofovir, FTC and raltegravir. The integrase inhibitor raltegravir has\\na low risk for interactions and side effects. Moreover, many studies suggest a faster\\nviral decay with this agent compared to other antiretrovirals. During tenofovir, renal\\nfunction should be monitored carefully. \\n426 AIDS'),\n",

In this case, the CHOP regimen is insufficient (Trümper 2001).\\nAlthough it is still unclear whether this is also true for HIV+ patients with Burkitt’s\\nlymphomas, many clinicians have in recent years tended to treat such patients more\\nintensively. A modified dose-adapted protocol of the German multicenter study\\ngroup for adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (GMALL) is usually used for the treat-\\nment of HIV-negative cases of Burkitt-NHL/B-ALL, and consists of four to six short,\\nintensive 5-day polychemotherapy cycles, alternating A and B cycles.

However,\\nthe GMALL protocol is very intensive and cannot be administered on an outpatient\\nbasis. Strict monitoring of patients in hospital for several weeks is very important.\\nCenters without experience should not administer it to HIV+ patients.\\nOther intensive therapies have been also reported (Ferreri 2013, Alwan 2015, Noy\\n2015). A significant problem with most studies is that there is no control group.\\nThere is no randomized study. However, there is increasing evidence that conven-\\ntionally treated patients with Burkitt’s lymphoma continue to have a worse prog-\\nnosis even in the age of combination ART (Lim 2005, Spina 2005). Although this\\nhas not been confirmed by all study teams (Bower 2005), intensive therapy should\\nbe considered for every patient with Burkitt’s lymphoma. A poor immune status or\\nthe existence of a concurrent opportunistic infection does not necessarily have to\\nbe an obstruction (Lehmann 2005). Interestingly, a new low-density approach with\\nthe R-EPOCH regime seems to be very effective, according to a small case series\\n(Dunleavy 2013).\\nPlasmablastic lymphomas : are a relatively “new” entity in HIV+ patients.\\nPlasmablastic lymphomas probably belong to the diffuse large cell NHLs, but display\\na completely characteristic immune phenotype, which usually correlates to a post-\\ngerminal center cell – markers for the B cell antigen CD20 are negative, whereas the\\nplasma-cell reactive antibodies VS38c and CD138 are positive (Brown 1998, Teruya-\\nFeldstein 2004). The oral cavity is the site of involvement (Gaidano 2002), although\\nextra-oral manifestations do occur (Chetty 2003). There is a close association with\\nan HHV-8 infection but also EBV (Castillo 2008, Riedel 2008). Like Burkitt’s lym-\\nphoma, plasmablastic lymphomas have a very high rate of proliferation and are\\nextremely aggressive. Prognosis remains poor (Castillo 2012, Schommers 2013). In\\na study on 89 people with NHL, we were able to show that a post-germinal center\\nprofile, as often occurs in plasmablastic lymphomas, is independently associated\\nwith a worse prognosis (Hoffmann 2005). This observation was confirmed by other\\ngroups (Dunleavy 2010). Intensive chemotherapy regimens do not seem to increase\\nsurvival (Castillo 2012). New options are urgently needed. These could include borte-\\nzomib, which is a selective potent proteasome inhibitor that has been approved for\\nclinical treatment of multiple myeloma and mantel cell lymphoma (Bibas 2010, Saga\\n2013, Castillo 2015, Fernandez-Alvarez 2015).\\nMalignant Lymphomas 427'),\n",

These lymphomas are often very difficult to diagnose histo-\\nlogically. A visible tumor mass is usually absent, so malignant cells can only be found\\nin body cavities (e.g., pleural, pericardial, peritoneal). There are histological similar-\\nities to immunoblastic and anaplastic cells with a non-B-, non-T phenotype. Every\\npleural or pericardial effusion occurring in an HIV+ patient and containing malig-\\nnant cells, is suspicious of PEL. The involved pathologist should always be informed\\nabout this suspicion. There is a characteristic close association with the herpes virus\\nHHV-8, which can be detected in malignant cells, and which provides a relatively\\ntypical gene expression profile (Simonelli 2005, Fan 2005). Recently, a solitary variant\\nhas been reported, which is neither morphologically nor immunophenotypically\\ndistinguishable from the classical PEL types (Chadburn 2004). \\nThe response to the CHOP regimen is usually poor and poorer than that of cen-\\ntroblastic NHL (Simonelli 2003). Case studies with complete remission on ART alone\\nhave been described (Boulanger 2001, Hocqueloux 2001). We have, however, seen\\ntwo PEL patients who have also died of progression despite CHOP and ART after\\nonly a few months. A small study reported encouraging results with a combined\\nchemotherapy with high-dose methotrexate. In at least 3/7 patients a complete remis-\\nsion was achieved – a notable achievement in view of the otherwise poor progno-\\nsis, and an approach that should be followed up (Boulanger 2003). On the other\\nhand, there are reports in which even intensive treatment regimens were unsuc-\\ncessful (Waddington 2004). A new option may be bortezomib, which is a selective\\npotent proteasome inhibitor. Xenograft models have shown that bortezomib induces\\nPEL remission, providing a rational basis for clinical evaluation (Sarosiek 2010).\\nRelapse therapy, stem cell transplantation\\nAt the moment, no general recommendations for relapse therapy of NHL can be\\ngiven. The prognosis of NHL relapse is poor. A team from the US reported their\\n positive experiences using the ESHAP protocol (etoposide, methylprednisolone, \\nara-C and cisplatin). DHAP appears to have no effect here (Bi 2001). The EPOCH\\nregimen may also be effective. Other salvage monotherapies with mitoguazone or\\nliposomal daunorubicin are purely palliative (Levine 1997, Tulpule 2001).\\nIt should always be checked whether the affected patient with a relapse of lymphoma\\nqualifies in principle for an autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). In ASCT, the\\nintensity of the chemotherapy can be markedly increased by the preceding gain of\\npluripotent stem cells (own cells: autologous; foreign cells: allogenic). Following the\\nmyeloablative chemotherapy, the patients are re-infused with the stem cells. Several\\nhundred cases of SCT in HIV+ patients have been described so far worldwide. They\\nhave clearly shown that efficacy is comparable to HIV-negative patients (Simonelli\\n2010, Krishnan 2010, Re 2013). Even a few allogenic SCT have been reported (Kang\\n2002, Bryant 2008, Gupta 2009, Oka 2010). \\nIn 2009, one of these cases attracted much intention. German researchers from Berlin\\ntransplanted stem cells from a donor who was homozygous for CCR5 delta32 in a\\npatient with acute myeloid leukemia and HIV-1 infection.

There is no doubt that this case offers great hope for\\npotential gene therapies. \\nThe critical problem of autologous SCT in many hematological centers is above all\\na logistical one, namely the complicated storage of stem cells, which has to conform\\nto strict safety regulations. \\n428 AIDS'),\n",

The incidence of PCNSL seems to have\\ndecreased significantly in the last years in comparison to systemic lymphomas\\n(Polesel 2008). PCNSL are EBV-associated in almost 100% of cases (Camilleri-Broet\\n1997). Histologically, findings are almost always consistent with diffuse large cell\\nnon-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. The CD4 T cells are almost always below 50/µl at the\\ntime of diagnosis. In the pre-HAART era, PCNSL had the poorest prognosis of all the\\nAIDS-defining illnesses, with a median survival of less than three months (Fine 1993).\\nIn more recent years, this bleak picture, often characterized by therapeutic nihilism,\\nhas changed significantly. In the HAART era, survival may be several years and com-\\nplete remission has become possible (Hoffmann 2001).\\nSigns and symptoms\\nDifferent neurological deficits occur depending on the localization. Epileptic seizures\\nmay be the first manifestation of disease. Personality changes, changes in awareness,\\nheadaches and focal deficits such as paresis are also frequent. Fever is usually absent.\\nAs patients are almost always severely immunocompromised, constitutional symp-\\ntoms may mask the real problem.\\nDiagnosis\\nCranial CT or (better) MRT scan should be performed rapidly. The most important\\ndifferential diagnosis is cerebral toxoplasmosis. A solitary mass is usually more indica-\\ntive of PCNSL. However, 2–4 lesions may be present, which are usually fairly large\\n(more than 2 cm in diameter). More than four lesions are rarely found.\\nIn addition to an updated toxoplasmosis serology, which – if negative – makes tox-\\noplasmosis very unlikely, a recent CD4 T cell count should be available. The better\\nthe immune status, the less likely the diagnosis of PCNSL. In our own cohort, less\\nthan 20% of patients had more than 50 CD4 T cells/µl at the time of diagnosis. At\\nover 100 CD4 T cells/µl, however, cerebral toxoplasmosis is also less likely.\\nIn addition to the physical examination, a minimal diagnostic program (chest radi-\\nography, abdominal ultrasound) should clarify whether the CNS involvement is sec-\\nondary to systemic lymphoma. This should always include fundoscopy to exclude\\nocular involvement (up to 20%).\\nBesides cerebral toxoplasmosis, differential diagnoses include abscesses, glioblastoma\\nand cerebral metastasis of solid tumors. In the absence of increased intracranial pres-\\nsure, lumbar puncture is advised. If steroids have already been administered, however,\\nthe probability of finding malignant cells is diminished. EBV DNA is commonly\\ndetected in the CSF of HIV+ patients. Quantitative EBV PCR in the CSF improves the\\ndiagnostic specificity, although the predictive value remains too low for it to be used\\nas an isolated marker for PCNSL (Corcoran 2008). In EBV positive cases, the possi-\\nbility of primary CNS lymphomatoid granulomatosis should be considered in any\\ndifferential diagnosis (Wyen 2006, Patsalides 2006).\\nIn most cases, a treatment attempt for toxoplasmosis can be made initially. If this is\\nunsuccessful, PCNSL is more likely. In such cases, stereotactic brain biopsy is essen-\\ntial to secure the diagnosis.\\nMalignant Lymphomas 433'),\n",

In HIV-negative patients, using the combination of radiation therapy and\\nsteroids, a remission of 12–18 months duration is usually achieved. In HIV+ patients\\nin the pre-HAART era, radiation only improved survival from 0.9 to 3.0 months (Fine\\n1993). Survival of more than one year was rare.\\nThe prognosis for HIV-negative patients has improved in the last years due to the\\nintroduction of methotrexate-based (MTX) chemotherapies (Carraba 2010) and of\\nrituximab (Korfel 2013). Whether these results will be applicable in HIV+ patients is\\nnot clear. In addition, the incidence of PCNSL is now diminishing to such an extent\\nthat convincing data on therapy efficacy can hardly be expected in the near future.\\nA clear recommendation for treatment cannot be made at this time.\\nSome clinicians still favor cranial radiation therapy alone in HIV+ patients (frac-\\ntionated, 40 Gy total dose). In our experience, before radiation a treatment attempt\\nwith intravenous MTX is justified (3 g/m\\n2 every 14 days with leucovorin rescue) –\\nalso in order to avoid possible neurological damage from radiation. A small study in\\nHIV+ patients has shown that this approach is practical (Jacomet 1997).\\nHowever, the decisive factor in all cases – independent of the specific therapy chosen\\n– is the best possible immune reconstitution. With ART, survival of several years has\\nbecome realistic. Complete remissions have even been described after treatment with\\nART alone (McGowan 1998, Aboufila 2007, Travi 2012). In our own cohort of\\n29 patients with histologically diagnosed PCNSL, all four patients who experienced\\nan increase in CD4 T cells survived longer than 18 months. Three out of four patients\\nreached complete remission. One patient has now lived for over eight years without\\nevidence of relapse (Hoffmann 2001). In a multivariate analysis, combination ART\\nwas shown to be the only factor associated with a prolonged survival in addition to\\ncranial radiation therapy. Two of these patients, however, died after about three years\\nof a progressive neurological syndrome, which was probably a long-term sequela of\\nradiation therapy in both cases. In view of the better prognosis for patients today,\\nradiation toxicity should be considered more than in the past. Three further studies\\nfrom France, the US and Australia have since shown a survival of several years thanks\\nto ART (Rigolet 2001, Skiest 2003, Newell 2004).\\nAll patients with PCNSL should therefore be treated intensively with antiretroviral\\ntherapy, to achieve the best possible immune reconstitution. If only a moderate\\nimmune reconstitution is possible, additional immunomodulatory or antiviral\\n therapies should be evaluated. The partially very positive reports about ganciclovir,\\nfoscarnet and interleukin-2 (Raez 1999, Aboulafia 2002, Marretta 2011) or hydrox-\\nyurea (Slobod 2000) should, however, be interpreted with caution. “Between the\\nlines” of these publications, in which either individual or hardly more than \\n2-4 patients were described, combination ART was almost always a factor.\\nIn all cases with signs of raised intracranial pressure, rapid administration of steroids\\n(e.g., dexamethasone 8 mg TID, decreasing the dose rapidly after resolution of edema)\\nis indicated, even if diagnostic testing is more difficult as a result. In the case of recur-\\nrent PCNSL, use of rituximab should be considered (Ferro 2012).\\nReferences\\nAboulafia DM, Puswella AL.

For particular subtypes, such as lymphocyte-depleted and\\nmixed-cellularity HL,the relative risk is presumably much higher (Frisch 2001).\\nDespite this and the growing realization that these subtypes at least are clearly asso-\\nciated with immunodeficiency, HIV-related HL is not included as an AIDS-defining\\nillness.\\nThere is growing evidence that the incidence of HIV-related HL is increasing in the\\nsetting of improved immunity. Several studies reported on an increased incidence\\nduring the last years (Clifford 2005, Biggar 2006, Engels 2008, Bohlius 2011). In our\\nown cohort we found significant differences between NHL and HL (Wyen 2008).\\nWhereas the majority of NHL cases is diagnosed in ART-naïve patients, HL mainly\\noccurred in subjects receiving a virologically effective ART. For example, in our own\\ncohort of 415 cases of systemic high-grade NHL and HL, significantly more patients\\nwith HL were treated with ART and had a viral load below 50 HIV RNA copies/ml at\\nlymphoma diagnosis than patients with NHL (57.3% vs. 27.9%, p<0.001), The pro-\\nportion of HL in the whole cohort was 20.7%. In the subgroup of ART-naïve patients\\nit was only 7% but increased to 35% in patients with current viral load below \\n50 HIV RNA copies/ml (Hoffmann 2014).\\nThe reason for this phenomenon is still not clear.

In addition, CD40/CD40L interactions and EBV  infection\\nmay contribute to constitutive activation of NFkB which is an antiapoptotic factor\\nin RS cells. Interestingly, patients whose CD4 T cell counts decline despite suppres-\\nsion of HIV-1 replication, are at risk for HL (Bohlius 2011).\\nAn advanced stage of disease at diagnosis is typical, as is frequent extranodal involve-\\nment and a trend towards prognostically poorer subtypes (Tirelli 1995, Rapezzi 2001,\\nThompson 2004). Mediastinal disease is significantly less frequent than in HIV-neg-\\native patients. A further difference to HL in seronegative patients is the predomi-\\nnance of cases with RS cells, as well as the clear association with EBV infection, which\\nis 80–100%, depending on the study. EBV infection is therefore seen as an important\\netiologic factor for development of HIV-related HL.\\nIn comparison to HIV-negative HL, which is a highly treatable tumor, the progno-\\nsis of HIV-related HL was poor in the pre-HAART era. In nearly all cohorts with more\\nthan 20 patients, the median survival was only between 15–20 months, respectively\\n(Tirelli 1995, Levine 2000). The response to chemotherapy was also moderate com-\\npared to the normal population. Complete remission rates were between 40 and\\n80%, and hematological and infectious complications were frequent. This gloomy\\nscenario has clearly changed since the introduction of combination ART. In our own\\nmulticenter cohort of 56 patients, the median survival was 40 months. In patients\\nwith adequate ART, the two-year survival rate was 84%, which was very encourag-\\ning (Hoffmann 2004). In the meantime, other groups have also reported better prog-\\nnoses with ART (Ribera 2002, Gérard 2003, Berenguer 2008). There is now over-\\nwhelming evidence that HIV status no longer influences outcome in patients with\\nclassical HL in the HAART era (Montoto 2013).\\nSigns and symptoms\\nB symptoms occur in the majority of cases. Extranodal and advanced stages are almost\\nalways the rule. Lymphomas are firm, immobile or hardly mobile and painless, and\\nthe distinction from HIV-related lymphadenopathy or tuberculous lymphadenitis is\\nnot always possible.\\nDiagnosis\\nStaging is necessary as for non-Hodgkin lymphomas (see NHL above). Diagnostic\\nlymph node extirpation is even more important here than with NHL, as puncture\\nonly rarely allows diagnosis of Hodgkin’s disease. Single accurate diagnostics are\\nbetter than half-heartedly bothering the patient with repeated punctures and losing\\ntime unnecessarily. Surgical extirpation is possible as an outpatient in many centers.\\nAs with NHL, specimens should be sent to reference laboratories if possible. Since\\nbleomycine will be administered, a lung function test should always precede the first\\nchemotherapy.\\nTreatment\\nRisk-adapted treatment strategy in patients with HIV-related HL in accordance with\\nstandard treatment procedures established for HIV-negative patients with HL is rec-\\nommended. The achievement of complete remission (CR) is important. In one larger\\ncohort, the only variable independently associated with overall survival was the\\nachievement of CR (Berenguer 2008). \\n436 AIDS'),\n",

Abstract 1026, 14th CROI 2008, Boston.\\nMulticentric Castleman’s disease (MCD)\\nAlthough rare, multicentric Castleman’s disease is a highly problematic illness for\\npatients – not only due to the poor prognosis in HIV infection, but also because\\nmany clinicians and pathologists are not very familiar with this entity. The usually\\nseverely ill patients are often subjected to diverse diagnostic and therapeutic proce-\\ndures. \\nIn comparison to the benign, localized hyperplasia of lymphatic tissue, first described\\nby Castleman in 1956, HHV-8-associated multicentric Castleman’s disease, as it\\noccurs in HIV infection, is a malignant lymphoproliferative disease (Oksenhendler\\n1996, Talat 2011). Although HIV-related MCD is not classified as a lymphoma or\\nAIDS-defining illness, prognosis is poor. In a prospective study, the median survival\\nwas 14 months (Oksenhendler 1996). According to a review on 84 cases with HIV-\\nrelated MCD, life expectancy of the patients seems to have significantly improved\\nin the era of combination ART with a mortality rate of only 29% (Mylona 2008).\\nDuring recent years, prognosis further improved, mainly due to the increased use of\\nthe monoclonal antibody rituximab (Bower 2011, Hoffmann 2011, Gérard 2012).\\nPathogenesis\\nThe pathogenesis of the disease is not completely understood. There is a close asso-\\nciation to HHV-8, and as a result about half of the patients also have KS. Lymph\\nnodes involved in HIV-related MCD are often involved coincidentally with KS\\n(Naresh 2008). HHV-8 viremia in patients with MCD is often higher than in patients\\nwith KS (Sayer 2011). HHV-8 encodes a homologue of IL-6 (viral IL-6) that has been\\nshown to be biologically active in several assays and whose activities mirror those\\nof its mammalian counterparts. In particular IL-6 and IL-10 are elevated with close\\nassociation to the HHV-8 viral load (Oksenhendler 2000). \\nViral IL-6 mediates its effects through the gp130 signal transducer, but signaling is\\nnot dependent on the structurally related IL-6 receptor subunit of the receptor-signal\\ntransducer complex (Moore 1996, Li 2001, Suthaus 2010). It is thus postulated that\\nviral IL-6 has a broader spectrum of potential target cells than human IL-6.

Of note, there are reports of MCD cases negative for HHV-8 infec-\\ntion (Seo 2009) but also of an IL-6-related systemic inflammatory syndrome in HIV+\\npatients with HHV-8 but without MMCD (Uldrick 2010).

We and others have seen\\nMCD patients with a normal immune status and low viral load (Powles 2009).\\nMoreover, ART does not appear to protect against HIV-related MCD. In our own\\ncohort of 52 patients, the majority of the patients with HIV-related MCD were already\\non ART and had a viral load of less than 400 copies/ml at the time of diagnosis\\n(Hoffmann 2011). It is also of note that HIV-related MCD, unlike KS, is not associ-\\nated with a lack of HHV-8-specific CD8 T cells or limitation of their functional profile\\n(Guihot 2008). There is also evidence that the incidence of HIV-related MCD is\\nincreasing. It appears to occur more frequently in older HIV-positive individuals with\\nwell-preserved immune function (Powles 2009).\\nProgression to malignant lymphoma (often HHV-8-associated entities such as PEL\\nor plasmablastic subtypes) is frequent. In by far the largest prospective study to date\\nwith 60 MCD cases, 14 patients developed malignant lymphoma after a median\\nobservation period of 20 months (Oksenhendler 2002). Subtypes mainly include rare\\nentities associated with HHV-8 infection, such as plasmablastic or primary effusion\\nlymphomas. In patients treated with rituximab, the lymphoma risk appears to be\\nsignificant lower than in patients treated with conventional chemotherapies\\n(Hoffmann 2011, Michot 2011).\\nSigns and symptoms\\nThe main signs are the often significant lymph node enlargements, which are almost\\nalways combined with considerable B symptoms including fever, night sweats and\\nweight loss. Almost all patients complain of weakness and severe malaise. There is\\nalways massive splenomegaly. Hepatomegaly (70%), respiratory symptoms (65%)\\nand edema with hypoalbuminemia (55%) are also seen in the majority of cases.\\nLymph nodes, which may be anything from very soft (as with tuberculosis) to rock\\nhard (as with lymphoma) on palpation, can normalize or relapse within weeks\\nwithout any intervention.\\nThe extent of symptoms is very variable and may fluctuate considerably. Many\\npatients report on “Castleman episodes”, lasting from a few days to one or two weeks.\\nBetween these episodes, most patients do again relatively well for weeks or even\\nmonths. In most patients who leave HIV-related MC untreated, the frequency of the\\nepisodic flares increases over time.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis is made histologically after lymph node extirpation – providing that\\nthe pathologist knows what HIV-related MCD looks like. Hyaline-vascular and plasma\\ncell types of Castleman’s disease can be distinguished. The classical pathological fea-\\ntures include angio-follicular hyperplasia and hypocellular germinal centers with\\nhyalinization and mantle zone hyperplasia.

Only a subset of mature, CD20-\\npositive B cells (“plasmablasts”) within the mantle zone is HHV-8-infected. \\nClinicians should explicitly indicate their suspicion. It is possible that a significant\\nproportion of cases are never correctly diagnosed. In every case of episodic flares of\\nB-symptoms, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and elevated CRP, the diagnosis of\\nHIV-related MCD must be considered. HIV alone rarely causes such severe illness! In\\nthe case of the symptoms described above, the pathological diagnosis of HIV-asso-\\nciated lymphadenopathy should not be accepted too easily.\\nUltrasound reveals hepatosplenomegaly. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) find-\\nings correlate well with activity, severity and inflammatory parameters in MCD\\n(Polizzotto 2015). Laboratory tests show hypoalbuminemia and hypergammaglob-\\nulinemia. There is often significant anemia which may be hemolytic, often reflect-\\ning pancytopenia or hemophagocytic syndrome (Stebbing 2009). \\nIn our experience, CRP is a useful parameter for monitoring the activity of HIV-\\nrelated MCD and observing the effectiveness of MCD treatment. During an episodic\\nflare, CRP levels of more than 100 mg/l can be seen. Between the episodes, however,\\nCRP is often within normal ranges. In some patients, clinical symptoms are preceded\\nby elevated CRP levels. Treatment success is reflected by sustained decrease of CRP.\\nDetermining the HHV-8 DNA level may also be useful in diagnosis and for follow-\\nup (Marcelin 2007, Sayer 2011, Stebbing 2011).\\nTreatment\\nIn patients with HIV+ MCD, something has to be done quickly as the course of\\ndisease can be extremely fulminant. According to newer data, we believe that the\\nuse of rituximab is the treatment of choice in HIV+ patients with MCD (see below).\\nSome experts advocate rituximab monotherapy for good performance in patients\\nwithout organ involvement and rituximab with chemotherapy for more aggressive\\ndisease (Bower 2010). However, there is no widely accepted recommendation for a\\nspecific treatment for MCD. A wide variety of strategies has been reported, includ-\\ning cytotoxic elimination of cells responsible for hypercytokinemia, anti-herpesvirus\\ntherapies and anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies. More recently,\\nblockade of IL-6 signaling with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have been discussed.\\nART should always be given, although it does not always help (Dupin 1997,\\nLanzafame 2000, Aaron 2002, de Jong 2003, Sprinz 2004). Some cases have even\\nbeen described to occur after starting ART, leading to the suspicion that the inflam-\\nmatory component of MCD may be increased by immune reconstitution (Zietz 1999). \\nRituximab: this monoclonal antibody against CD20-expressing cells is also used in\\nB cell lymphomas (see above). It has been speculated that rituximab is effective in\\nHIV-related MCD by eliminating or reducing the pool of HHV-8 infected B cells which\\nare localized mainly in the mantle zone of lymph nodes. Rituximab has been tried\\nwith success in several patients with HIV-related MCD (Corbellino 2001, Marcelin\\n2003, Casquero 2006). At least two larger studies showed encouraging results. In a\\nFrench study, 16/24 patients with HIV-related MCD reached a complete remission\\nof clinical symptoms after four cycles of rituximab (Gérard 2006). The overall sur-\\nvival (OS) after one year was 92% and the disease-free survival (DFS) was 74%. In a\\nBritish study, 20/21 patients achieved a clinical remission with rituximab, and 14/21\\npatients showed a radiological response (Bower 2007). After two years, OS and DFS\\nwere 95% and 79%, respectively. CRP, immunoglobulins, cytokines such as IL-5, \\nIL-6 or IL-10 and HHV-8 viremia decreased after treatment (Bower 2009). In our\\ncohort, rituximab markedly improved prognosis in HIV-infected patients with MCD,\\n440 AIDS'),\n",

There is also\\nevidence that rituximab decreases the risk of lymphoma (Bower 2011, Gérard 2012). \\nRituximab is usually given at a dose of 375 mg / m\\n2 body surface, once weekly over\\nfour weeks. Attention should be paid to good hydration. Rituximab is usually well\\ntolerated. The main adverse event seems to be a reactivation of KS, which is seen in\\nup to a third of the cases (Bower 2007). A recent study suggested that KS progres-\\nsion can be prevented by combination of rituximab with liposomal doxorubicin\\n(Uldrick 2014). Rituximab is also effective as retreatment for rituximab-pretreated\\nHIV-related MCD (Powles 2007). Based on the data published to date and on our\\nown experience, we would consider rituximab to be the first option in patients with\\nHIV-related MCD. However, there also some case reports in which rituximab was not\\nsuccessful (Neuville 2005, Buchler 2008). For these cases, other therapeutical\\napproaches are briefly discussed here. \\nValganciclovir: promising, as this antiviral agent may act against HHV-8. As shown\\nby a randomized trial, valganciclovir significantly reduces the frequency and quan-\\ntity of HHV-8 replication (Casper 2008). More recently, preliminary data suggest that\\nvalgancyclovir (combined with high-dose AZT) is active in HIV-related MCD. Of 14\\npatients, 12 had “clinical improvement”, showing a decline of inflammatory markers\\nsuch as CRP, IL-6 and HHV-8 viremia (Uldrick 2011). However, in our own cohort\\nwe were unable to confirm these findings (Hoffmann 2011). According to some\\nexperts, valganciclovir may have a role as maintenance therapy in the future (Bower\\n2010). In contrast, antiviral therapy with foscarnet or cidofovir had no benefit (Coty\\n2003, Senanayake 2003, Berezne 2004). \\nChemotherapy: well-tolerated chemotherapies such as vincristine (2 mg IV as a bolus\\nat 14-day intervals) or oral etoposide (50 mg daily) have proven effective according\\nto several reports as well as our own experience (Scott 2001, Kotb 2006). CHOP stan-\\ndard chemotherapy can help, but does not seem to significantly prolong survival.\\nSplenectomy:may be appropriate in severe cases. It is speculated that IL-6 production\\nis reduced and that a large reservoir of HHV-8 is removed through the splenectomy.\\nIn a series of 40 patients, the median survival following splenectomy was 28 versus\\n12 months (Oksenhendler 2002). According to a US study, the symptoms were\\nimproved in 10/10 patients following splenectomy (Coty 2003). \\nAnti-IL-6 antibodies: In HIV-negative patients, very optimistic data from Japan have\\nbeen published, in which patients were successfully treated with anti-IL-6 receptor\\nantibodies such as tocilizumab (Nishimoto 2005, Matsuyama 2007). In Europe,\\ntocilizumab was approved in 2009 for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. However,\\nthere only case reports for HIV-related MCD (Nagao 2014). Data is also lacking for\\nsiltuximab, a new IL-6 antibody. In a randomized trial of 53 patients with idiopathic\\nMCD (negative for HHV-8 and HIV), 34% achieved a durable response (van Rhee\\n2014).\\nThalidomide: This drug is believed to inhibit cytokine dysregulation as well as the\\ninflammatory component of MCD. Case reports in HIV-related MCD exist (Lee 2003,\\nJung 2004). It should be noted that thalidomide has been associated with venous\\nthromboembolic events, including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli.\\nAnticoagulation during thalidomide administration is mandatory. We have seen two\\npatients developing pulmonary emboli despite anticoagulation. Therefore we would\\nnot recommend the use of thalidomide in HIV-related MCD.\\nOther immune therapies: For interferon, there are positive as well as negative exam-\\nples (Coty 2003, Nord 2003). Steroids have no effect on MCD.\\nMalignant Lymphomas 441'),\n",

Non-AIDS-defining Malignancies\\nCHRISTIAN HOFFMANN\\nHIV+ patients have an increased risk of cancer. This applies not only to the three\\nAIDS-defining malignancies (ADMs), namely Kaposi’s sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lym-\\nphoma and cervix carcinoma, but also to different non-AIDS-defining malignancies\\n(non-ADMs). The risk for non-ADMs is approximately two to three times higher in\\nHIV+ patients than in the non-infected population (Frisch 2001, Franceschi 2010).\\nIncidence of some diseases such as Hodgkin lymphoma (see Malignant lymphomas)\\nand anal carcinoma are so high that there is, according to many experts, a demand\\nto classify them as ADM. In contrast, breast cancer incidence is either same or less\\ncompared to the general population (Latif 2011).\\nOne-third of all malignancies in HIV+ patients today are non-ADMs. They are, there-\\nfore, as frequent as malignant lymphomas and Kaposi’s sarcoma (Engels 2006). Over\\nthe last years, incidence has remained relatively stable (Worm 2013). As a result,\\nnon-ADMs are a significant mortality factor within the HIV+ population. In indus-\\ntrial countries, more deaths are attributed to non-ADMs than to ADMs, hepatitis C\\nor cardiovascular diseases. Non-AIDS cancer is now the leading non-AIDS cause of\\ndeath and without any evidence of improvement. In the D:A:D cohort, the propor-\\ntion among specific causes of death in people with HIV increased from 9% in 1999–\\n2000 to 23% in 2009–2014 (Smith 2014).

The high risk persists if CD4 nadir was low\\n(Worm 2012). This correlation between non-ADM and severe immune deficiency is\\nfrom the EuroSIDA study (Reekie 2010). In a US databank analysis which included\\n300,000 AIDS patients (Frisch 2001), some malignomas cases were associated with\\nimmunodeficiency: Hodgkin’s lymphoma, lung cancer, penile carcinoma, soft tissue\\nsarcomas, testical and lip cancer.\\nApart from immunodeficiency, other factors certainly play a role. Mainly smoking\\nbut also life-style (alcohol, UV exposure) or coinfections (HPV , HBV , HCV) contribute\\nto the risk. In the absence of smoking, however, the increase in risk is confined to\\ncancers related to viral infections, whereas the risk of other cancers is not elevated\\nand does not seem to be associated with immune deficiency (Helleberg 2014). Given\\nthe fact that HIV+ patients are aging, an increase of incidences of malignancies is to\\nbe expected (Shiels 2011). ART seems to have little influence on the occurrence of\\nnon-ADMs since therapy interruption does not increase the risk for non-ADMs, in\\ncontrast to ADMs (Silverberg 2007).\\nEarly diagnosis and prevention\\nIt remains unclear whether HIV+ patients require cancer screening and preventive\\nmedical checkups more frequently than negative patients. There are some indica-\\ntions for a benefit regarding anal carcinomas (see below). Regarding colon carcinoma\\nthe situation is not clear; however, there is evidence that neoplastic changes are\\nfound more frequently in colorectal cancer screening with HIV+ patients (Bini 2009,\\nBoesecke 2012). This examination, however, is not so popular with HIV+ patients or\\nwith treating physicians. Compared to the HIV-negative population, colorectal\\ncancer screening is utilized to a lesser degree (Reinhold 2005). With respect to PSA\\nscreening, which is discussed controversially in general, there is no specific recom-\\nmendation for HIV+ patients (Tyerman 2012). Gynaecological examinations are dis-\\ncussed in the chapter HIV and Gynaecology . In patients coinfected with HCV , bi-\\nannual ultrasound sonographies can have a benefit, as a recent study with 70 patients\\nshowed: hepatocellular carcinomas were less progressed at diagnosis in regularly\\nscreened patients resulting in a slightly better survival (Nunez 2010).  \\nFinally, physicians should inform patients about the advantages of not smoking and\\nsupport smoking cessation. Smoking contributes to substantial morbidity and mor-\\ntality in the HIV+ population (Lifson 2010). Patients often request and insist upon\\nmore medical checkups, but it is repeatedly forgotten that abstinence from smoking\\nis still the most important preventive measure for malignant diseases.\\nIn a setting where care is well organized and antiretroviral therapy is free of charge,\\nHIV+ smokers lose more life-years to smoking than to HIV. The population-attrib-\\nutable risk of death associated with smoking is doubled compared to the background\\npopulation (Helleberg 2013). In the absence of smoking, the increase of many cancers\\nis not elevated and does not seem to be associated with immune deficiency (Helleberg\\n2014).\\nThus, smoking cessation, avoidance of obesity and a healthy lifestyle are more helpful\\nthan expensive medical examinations.  \\nTreatment \\nOne problem in the therapy of non-ADMs is that too little is known about chemother-\\napeutic substances and their interactions with ART. Especially since the new targeted\\nsubstances have mostly not been investigated in HIV+ patients. There are no prospec-\\ntive studies and very little data on imatinib, erlotinib, sunitinib, bortezomib,\\nNon-AIDS-defining Malignancies 445'),\n",

Few case reports exist for many\\nmalignant diseases. In most cases patients are younger compared to the HIV-nega-\\ntive population which may be due to better monitoring (Shiels 2010). Publications\\nover the last years on different entities such as glioblastoma (Hall 2009) or colon\\n carcinoma (Chapman 2009, Alfa-Wali 2011), bladder cancer (Gaughan 2009),\\nprostate cancer (Pantanowitz 2008) or esophageal cancer (Stebbing 2010) show that\\nHIV+ patients prosper from the recent and amazing progress made in the oncolog-\\nical field. There should be no difference in treatment of HIV+ and non-infected\\npatients – however, oncologists often need to be properly informed in order to avoid\\nadhering to an outdated and pessimistic concept of HIV treatment.\\nAnal carcinoma \\nAnal cancer (AC) is probably the most frequent non-ADM. There is a close associa-\\ntion to infections with human papilloma virus (HPV). An overwhelming number of\\nstudies and reviews has been published over the last decade, including several reports\\non dramatic increases of the AC incidence in HIV+ MSM. Moreover, there is a high\\nprevalence of pre-stage AC, the so-called anal intraepithelial neoplasias (AINs). High-\\ngrade AINs (HGAINs), the precursors for anal cancer, are present in about 30% of\\ncases. This has led to considerable concerns and uncertainty in patients and physi-\\ncians. Unfortunately, large, good-quality prospective studies are lacking and there is\\nstill controversy about whether to routinely screen for AC in HIV+ patients. Here we\\nwill carefully review the available data.\\nEpidemiology, HPV association \\nHPV infections are among the most frequently sexually transmitted virus infections.\\nHPV belongs to the family of papovaviridae and infect the basal cells of the epithe-\\nlium of the skin and mucous membranes. HIV+ patients have a 2 to 6-fold higher\\nrisk for anal HPV infection, independent of sex and sexual practices (Palefsky 1998,\\nPiketty 2003). Risk of persistent HPV infection is 7-fold and inversely correlated with\\nCD4 T cell counts (Piketty 2003). By now almost 100 different HPV types are known,\\namong them 20 that are associated with anal or cervix carcinomas. In particular,\\nHPV-16 and -18 have a high oncogenic potential. \\nHIV+ patients commonly have coinfections with several HPV subtypes (Machalek\\n2012). In a German study (Kreuter 2005), anal HPV infection was found in 86% of\\n103 male patients, among them especially HPV-16 (53%) and HPV-18 (27%), but also\\nHPV-58 (22%) and HPV-83 (22%).  Persistent HPV infection may lead to precancer-\\nous preliminary stages, the anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN). \\nThere is no doubt that anal cancer rates are substantially higher for HIV+ patients.\\nIn a large study, the adjusted rate ratios were 80 for MSM and 27 for other men com-\\npared with HIV-uninfected men (Silverberg 2012). The risk is also elevated in HIV+\\nwomen in whom high grade AINs are frequently found (Hou 2012). When discussing\\nthe high relative risk of HIV+ patients, one should consider, however, that anal cancer\\nis very rare in the general population. This means that a “substantially” or “dra-\\nmatically” higher risk compared to the general population does not inevitably mean\\na high absolute risk. According to one systematic review (Machalek 2012), the pooled\\nanal cancer incidence was 46 per 100,000 patient years in MSM. In HIV+ patients,\\nthe incidence increased from 22 to 78 in the HAART era. Incidence differs region-\\nally and is highest in the US at 147 (Chiao 2013). In the D:A:D cohort, mainly includ-\\ning HIV+ patients from Europe, the incidence per 100,000 patient years is only 45\\n(Worm 2013), in the Suisse Cohort even lower at 25 (Francesci 2010).\\n446 AIDS'),\n",

Moreover, the risk elevation is not the same\\nfor all HIV+ patients. In particular, AC incidence appears to be higher in patients\\nwith a low CD4 T cell nadir (Piketty 2012, Bertisch 2013, Chiao 2013, Duncan 2015).\\nCumulative HIV viremia and smoking are further risk factors (Bertisch 2013, Chiao\\n2013). There seems to be no strong protective effect of ART. In our own cohort of\\n121 patients with anal carcinoma, the vast majority of patients were on ART, with\\na well suppressed viremia and a median CD4 T cell count of 400/µl (Hoffmann 2011).\\nIt seems possible that cumulative use of PIs may be associated with a higher risk of\\nanal cancer (Bruyand 2015).\\nAnal cancer screening, treatment of pre-stages\\nAIN is histologically graded depending on the degree of dysplasia in grade 1 (mild),\\ngrade 2 (moderate) or grade 3 (severe). In the latter, the whole epidermis is affected.\\nAINs II/III or high grade AINs (HGAINs) are very common and are found in around\\none third of all HIV+ patients. It is important to remember that even these HGAINs\\ndo not inevitably lead to invasive cancer. According to a large systematic review the\\nrisk of anal cancer is relatively low (Machalek 2013). In total, the theoretical pro-\\ngression rate from HGAIN to anal cancer was calculated to be one in 633 patients\\n(one in 377 in the HAART era) per year in HIV+ men, and one in 4,196 patients per\\nyear in HIV-negative men. Thus, the majority of HGAIN will never progress to anal\\ncancer, and progression might occur less often than it does for cervical intraepithelial\\nneoplasias (CINs). Even HGAINs have a high potential for spontaneous regression\\n(Tong 2013, Grulich 2014). \\nAt first glance, early detection and treatment of precursors seems to be important,\\nsince often many years can pass between AIN and AC manifestation. However, given\\nthe low progression rates as shown above, treatment of AIN bears a considerable risk\\nfor overtreatment. There is only limited data supporting current guidelines insisting\\nthat digital anorectal examinations as well as perianal and intra-anal smears should\\nbe taken yearly (Review: Ong 2014). The substantial differences in the natural history\\nof anal HPV infection to those of cervical HPV infection suggest that one cannot\\nsimply transfer cervical cancer screening strategies to anal cancer screening. Until\\nevidence from large prospective studies is available, screening for anal cancer should\\nbe done only in research settings. More data is needed on progression and regres-\\nsion rates of HGAIN and on biomarkers that predict HGAIN or anal cancer. To date,\\nmany HIV physicians remain ambivalent regarding screening for anal cancer (Ong\\n2015).\\nThis applies also to treatment of HGAINs. The absence of reliable evidence for any\\nof the interventions used in AIN precludes any definitive guidance or recommen-\\ndations for clinical practice (Macaya 2012).\\nSo what do do? In case of AIN 1, a topical therapy with imiquimod (or podophyl-\\nlotoxin) may be adequate, AIN 2+3 can be removed either surgically (electrocaustic\\ntherapy) or via laser ablation. Infrared coagulation is also possible (Stier 2008). In a\\nrandomized study on 148 HIV+ MSM with AIN, three procedures were compared,\\nincluding 16 weeks of imiquimod (3 x / week), 5-FU (twice a week), and monthly\\nelectrocautery for 4 months. This study showed that regarding both efficacy and side\\neffects electrocautery is superior to imiquimod and 5-FU in treatment of AIN, but\\nrecurrence rates were substantial (Richel 2012).\\nCondyloma should be dissected by a proctologist (electrocoagulation, cryotherapy).\\nA topical therapy alone with the immune modulator imiquimod (Aldara\\n® cream) is\\npossible, however the effects are often less than with non-infected patients.

The mecha-\\nnism of imiquimod is not directly antiviral, instead it almost certainly destroys tumor\\ncells via cytokine induction. The most significant side effect is a local erythema\\n(which means it is working!), more seldom may be burning and pruritis. Severe skin\\nirritations are rare. \\nDiagnosis of anal cancer\\nThe most common symptom in cases of anal carcinoma is rectal bleeding. A patient\\nreporting blood in stool absolutely must visit a proctologist! Patients usually attrib-\\nute the bleeding to hemorrhoids; however, this self-made diagnosis should not be\\ntrusted. Other symptoms are burning and pain during stool or pruritus. If an anal\\ncarcinoma has already developed squamous cell carcinoma and more seldom tran-\\nsitory epithelial carcinoma are histologically present. Anal canal and sphincter can\\nalready be infiltrated at an early stage. Regional lymph nodes are affected depend-\\ning upon where the anal carcinoma is localized. Deep-seated anal carcinomas infil-\\ntrate inguinal, central pelvic, high lying mesentery. Distant metastases are rare. In\\naddition to proctoscopy, if possible, an endosonography, a CT of the abdomen and\\nthe pelvis should be done. \\nTreatment of anal cancer\\nIf anal carcinoma manifests and the lesion is smaller than 2 cm, a continence pre-\\nserving operation is preferable. In these cases, an adjuvant chemo- or radiotherapy\\nis not necessary. Larger lesions are treated with combined radio-chemotherapy (mit-\\nomycin 10 mg/m\\n2 on days 1 and 29 and 5-FU 1000 mg/m 2 on days 1–5 and days\\n29–33, with subsequent radiation therapy of up to 50 Gray in fractions). Other more\\nintensive therapies are possible (Blazy 2005). Complications can occur under such\\nregimens. If something can go wrong, it will: we have experienced a patient who\\nhad first developed severe extravasation under mitomycin, followed by myocardial\\ninfarction under 5-FU and then a perforating, feculent radiation colitis. \\nAdditionally patients should always be treated in oncological departments. Following\\nradiotherapy, a proctoscopy should take place every six months. Although positive\\neffects are not certain (Bowler 2005), HIV+ patients with anal carcinoma should\\nreceive ART. Overall prognosis is not worse than with HIV-negative patients (Chiao\\n2008, Hoffmann 2011, Alfa-Wali 2012).\\nHPV vaccines \\nHPV vaccines have proven to be protective for intraepithelial neoplasia and persistent\\nHPV infections in cases of cervix carcinoma (Harper 2006). In 2011, a large study\\nconfirmed that use of the qHPV vaccine also reduces the rates of anal intraepithe-\\nlial neoplasia, including grade 2 or 3, among men who have sex with men (Palefsky\\n2011). The vaccine had a favorable safety profile and may help to reduce the risk of\\nanal cancer. There is also some evidence for a therapeutic effect of the vaccine in\\nHPV-infected patients (Anderson 2009, Wilkin 2010). The approved vaccines induce\\na sufficient immune response (Toft 2014).\\nTesticular tumors\\nTesticular tumors are the most frequently occurring cancer in men between 20 and\\n35.

So far, the largest analyses\\nreport of 34 and 35 patients (Powles 2003, Fizazi 2001). The median CD4 T cell\\ncounts were between 300 and 350/µl at time of diagnosis, although with great vari-\\nation. Overall prognosis was good and a matched-pair analysis did not prove worse\\nwith HIV+ patients (Powles 2004). Other studies confirm the positive course (Fizazi\\n2001). Patients should be treated with the standard regimens that are also recom-\\nmended for negative patients. Depending on histology and stage of cancer, the\\nregimen consists of orchiectomy, lymph node extirpation or radiation, and or a\\n platinum-based chemotherapy. High dose therapies are also possible (Hentrich 2009).\\nTreatment should be performed in cooperation with a urologist experienced in\\n oncology and an HIV specialist.  \\nLung cancer\\nIn the general population, lung cancer is the most frequent cancer disease that leads\\nto death in male patients. This tendency is increasing in women and already ranks\\nthird. The risk seems to be rising with HIV+ patients. More recent studies from France\\nshow that lung carcinoma accounts for 5% of all causes of death and leads more fre-\\nquently to death than Kaposi’s sarcoma (Bonnet 2009). In a British cohort, the rel-\\native risk in the early years of the HIV epidemic was similar to that of the normal\\npopulation and has now risen by a factor of 8 (Bower 2003). In other cohorts, rela-\\ntive risk remained constant between 3–10 (Engels 2006, Cadranel 2006, Dal Maso\\n2009). Overall risk seems to rise as immunodeficiency increases (Guiguet 2009, Reekie\\n2011). In our own retrospective study of 72 patients developing lung cancer during\\nthe last decade, most cases occurred in the setting of limited immune deficiency and\\na long-lasting sufficient viral suppression (Hoffmann 2011). \\nThis increase can partly be explained by simple reasons: first, HIV+ patients live\\nlonger and have more time to develop lung cancer and second, HIV+ patients smoke\\nmore than non-infected patients. In some HIV outpatient clinics, up to 60–70% of\\nthe patients are smokers. Smoking remains the main risk factor for developing lung\\ncancer (Hoffmann 2011, Clifford 2012). Thus, one should discuss the issue of\\nsmoking: “It’s time to quit” – there are possibilities to cease smoking (Niaura 2000).\\nApart from age and nicotine abuse, other factors also seem determine an increased\\nrisk (Kirk 2007, Chaturvedi 2007). This is underlined by the fact that the most fre-\\nquent subtype found in HIV+ patients, adenocarcinoma, is the subtype that is least\\nassociated with nicotine consumption (Cadranel 2006). Because often immune defi-\\nciency is not present, other factors, such as specific lung infections and a resulting\\nscarring, are assumed, but also increased proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs or\\nreduced glutathione levels are found frequently in HIV+ individuals. These factors\\ncan worsen the damage caused by smoking. Generally, HIV+ patients seem to be\\nmore sensitive towards carcinogenesis (Engels 2006, Kirk 2007, Chaturvedi 2007). In\\nthe US veterans cohort, an increased risk for HIV+ patients remained significant,\\neven after adjusting for smoking, age, ethnicity and COPD (Sigel 2010). There is also\\nsome evidence for a genetic predisposition (Engsig 2011).\\nFrom a diagnostic-therapeutic view, patients always stand a better chance when the\\nlung cancer has been diagnosed early. Symptoms are unspecific and when they\\npresent, it is often too late. In the case of HIV+ patients, diagnosis is seldom early\\nenough. In our own cohort of 72 cases of lung cancer diagnosed 2000-2010, only\\n34% of the patients were in stages I-IIIa which are considered to be curable (Hoffmann\\n2011). Patients in early tumor stages should undergo surgery with curative  intention\\nsince chemotherapy only suspends further progression for a few months (Cadranel\\n2006, Lavolé 2009).

HIV and HBV/HCV Coinfections\\nCHRISTOPH BOESECKE, JAN-CHRISTIAN WASMUTH AND JÜRGEN K. ROCKSTROH\\nHIV and HCV coinfection\\nEpidemiology and Transmission\\nCoinfection with HIV and HCV occurs frequently, due to the fact that they are trans-\\nmitted via the same pathways (parenteral, sexual, vertical). In the US about 25% of\\nHIV+ individuals are estimated to be infected with both viruses. Several European\\ncountries have even higher rates of coinfection (Rockstroh 2005). In Russia, about\\n70% of the 940,000 HIV+ patients are also HCV-positive as a result of the high inci-\\ndence of IV drug users. Needle exchange programs have resulted in a marked decline\\nin new infections of HCV in Western Europe. For example, in Barcelona the preva-\\nlence of HCV coinfection in persons with newly diagnosed HIV-infection has\\ndecreased from 24% during 2000–2002 to 10% in 2006–2008 (Trevino 2009).\\nHCV is ten times more infectious than HIV via blood-to-blood contact. Intravenous\\ndrug users and recipients of blood products are particularly susceptible to coinfec-\\ntion. Nevertheless, the probability of transmission from occupational needlestick\\ninjuries after exposure to HCV-contaminated blood is less than 2%, possibly even\\nlower; i.e., 0.3% as after exposure to HIV-contaminated blood (Kubitschke 2007).\\nIn contrast, sexual transmission of HCV occurs significantly less frequently than HBV\\nor HIV (risk of transmission via heterosexual intercourse is <1%). About 4–8% of all\\nHIV+ men who have sex with men (MSM) are also infected with HCV. The first cases\\nof acute hepatitis C among HIV+ MSM were observed in London, Paris, Amsterdam\\nand Berlin but have spread to a worldwide epidemic over the last decade (Boesecke\\n2015). The risk of transmission depends on concomitant sexually transmitted dis-\\neases such as syphilis or lymphogranuloma venereum, performance of sexual prac-\\ntices that are prone to injuries of the mucosal membranes like fisting or intensive\\nrepetitive anal sex, and intravenous use of recreational drugs (“Chem sex”) (Vogel\\n2005, GMFA 2013). \\nPerinatal transmission of hepatitis C is rare in immunocompetent individuals (<1%).\\nThe transmission rate rises with increasing immunosuppression in HIV+ mothers,\\nand is estimated to be as high as 20%. On the other hand, HIV+ mothers treated\\neffectively with antiretroviral therapy do not appear to have an increased risk for\\nmaterno-fetal transmission of the hepatitis C virus (<3% with cesarean section)\\n(Pembrey 2005). Cesarean section did not reduce the risk of transmission to the\\nnewborn of HCV-monoinfected women putting the role of cesarean section into\\nquestion (Indolfi 2009).\\nClinical course and pathogenesis\\nThe clinical course of hepatitis C and HIV coinfection is determined by HIV-associ-\\nated immunosuppression. Progression of immunosuppression accelerates the course\\nof hepatitis C. Conversely, there is no significant influence of hepatitis C on the\\ncourse of HIV infection (Rockstroh 2005). \\nThe latent period until development of liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma in\\ncoinfected patients is estimated to be 10–20 years, whereas it is 30–40 years in \\nHCV-monoinfected patients (Benhamou 1999). Improved treatment options for HIV\\ninfection have increased the likelihood of patients actually living to experience the\\ndevelopment of liver failure which has become at least in some centers a frequent\\ncause of death (Rosenthal 2007). ART can improve the unfavorable course of hepa-\\n454'),\n",

This is particularly true for patients\\nwho achieve good immune recovery (Pineda 2007). Therefore and as a result of the\\nSTART study (see ART chapter) initiation of ART regardless of CD4 T cell count is\\nrecommended in HCV-coinfected patients (EACS 2015).\\nOn the other hand, hepatitis C infection can aggravate the potential hepatotoxicity\\nof ART regimens. Up to 10% of patients have to discontinue ART due to severe hepa-\\ntotoxicity. This risk is associated especially with the so-called “d drugs” (ddI, d4T).\\nThese agents should be avoided in coinfected patients. Nevirapine and tipranavir\\nshould be used with caution. In some coinfected patients, a temporary increase in\\ntransaminases is observed after initiation of ART. This most likely corresponds to an\\nincreased inflammatory activity of hepatitis C as a result of improved immune status.\\nNevertheless, long-term follow-up has shown that ART improves the course of\\n hepatitis C. \\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnostic tests in coinfected patients are no different from those used in HCV\\nmonoinfection (see Table 1). Detection of HCV antibodies (anti-HCV) confirms expo-\\nsure to HCV , but does not distinguish between resolved and chronic hepatitis C.\\nChronic hepatitis C is diagnosed by the detection of HCV viremia (HCV RNA). It\\nshould be noted that HCV antibodies might be lost during the course of HIV infec-\\ntion as a result of the underlying immunosuppression, although nowadays this\\n phenomenon has become rare, probably due to improved test kits. It may therefore\\nbe useful to determine HCV RNA levels, even if the anti-HCV test is negative, if there\\nis clinical suspicion or advanced immunodeficiency (it can also occur in patients\\nundergoing chemotherapy). Similarly, determination of HCV RNA levels is indicated\\nin cases of suspected acute HCV infection. HCV antibodies usually only become\\ndetectable one to five months after infection. In one study, they were still lacking\\nin 37% of patients 3 months after first detecting HCV RNA (Thomson 2009).\\nPatients with HIV/HCV coinfection have significantly higher levels of HCV viremia\\nthan patients with HCV monoinfection (about 1 log). Based on current knowledge\\nthe level of viremia does not have a prognostic value for the course of hepatitis C.\\nHowever, it should be noted that some patients might lose HCV RNA in parallel with\\nprogression of immune deficiency, but experience a flare up of hepatitis C together\\nwith clinical symptoms following immune reconstitution on ART (Kim 2006).\\nTherefore, regular testing around the initiation of ART seems prudent.\\nWhen considering the treatment of hepatitis C, genotyping is necessary before start-\\ning. Six genotypes with numerous subtypes are known, and are seen to have differ-\\nent regional distributions: genotypes 1 and 3 are predominantly found in Europe,\\nwhereas genotypes 4 and 5 are found in Africa, and genotype 6 in Asia. Genotypes\\n2 and 3 in particular have been associated with significantly better responses to inter-\\nferon-containing therapy. Coinfection with several genotypes is possible.\\nAnother marker associated with response to interferon-containing treatment is deter-\\nmination of IL28B genotype. This is a T/C dimorphism close to a region coding for\\nhuman interleukin 28B. Likelihood of response to interferon-containing, direct\\nacting antiviral (DAA)-free treatment is about twofold higher in IL28B CC genotype\\nthan with the TT variant (Nattermann 2011). Spontaneous clearance in case of acute\\ninfection is better in CC genotype patients as well.\\nAssessment of liver fibrosis is very important to assess liver disease stage. Among\\nseveral non-invasive methods available the Fibroscan\\n® device is of special interest.\\nThis device measures liver stiffness directly correlated to the degree of fibrosis with\\na special technique (transient elastography). \\nHIV and HBV/HCV Coinfections    455'),\n",

Other causes of liver disease should be identified by blood tests and liver biopsy if\\nneeded. \\nThere are several histological classifications used. In Europe the METAVIR score is\\nmost often used. It distinguishes five stages of fibrosis (0 = no fibrosis, 1 = portal\\nfibrosis without septa, 2 = some septa, 3 = significant septa without cirrhosis, 4 = cir-\\nrhosis). Hepatitis activity is graded according to the intensity of necroinflammatory\\nlesions (A0 = no activity, A1 = mild activity, A2 = moderate activity, A3 = severe activ-\\nity). As fibrosis progression is accelerated in HIV+ patients, monitoring of fibrosis in\\nyearly intervals seems prudent. An increase of 2 or more stages in liver fibrosis after\\nonly 3 years was observed in 25% of all coinfected patients in one study (Sulkowski\\n2007).\\nIf there is clinical suspicion requiring the detection or exclusion of extrahepatic man-\\nifestations (vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, systemic cryoglobulinemia), appropriate\\ninvestigations may be necessary (skin biopsy, urine tests, kidney biopsy, detection\\nof serum cryoglobulins).\\nThe recommendations for diagnostic procedures in HCV/HIV-coinfected patients can\\nbe found in Table 1.

Mainly patients\\nwith high-risk sexual contacts are affected. These include “chem sex” (see above),\\nunprotected anal intercourse, use of insertive sex toys and fisting. Diagnosis of acute\\nhepatitis C is made according to anamnesis, elevated liver enzymes (usually 5-fold\\nrise above the upper limit of normal; ideally to be documented as normal previously)\\nand positive HCV RNA. HCV antibodies will be negative in many instances due to\\nthe long latency of the antibody response. Infection may possibly be missed, as it\\nwill be asymptomatic in about one half up to 2/3 of patients.\\nUp to 20% of HIV+ patients with acute hepatitis C clear the virus spontaneously (up\\nto 40% in HCV monoinfection). Factors such as IL28B CC genotype, female sex,\\nsexual transmission (versus intravenous drug abuse), or symptomatic course have\\nbeen associated with a higher likelihood of clearance. In the absence of randomized,\\ncontrolled data on the use of DAAs in acute HCV coinfection, treatment with pegy-\\nlated interferon and ribavirin should be based on an individual decision. The known\\ntoxicities and longer treatment duration under dual therapy should be weighed\\nagainst a potentially strong patient wish for early HCV cure, particularly in HIV+\\nMSM with a higher risk of HCV transmission and in countries where DAAs will only\\nbe reimbursed in chronic HCV infection with \\n/H11350F3 fibrosis. After diagnosis of acute\\ninfection, HCV RNA should be measured 4 weeks later. Treatment can be discussed\\nin persons without a decrease of 2 logs of HCV RNA at 4 weeks compared with initial\\nHCV RNA and in persons with persistent serum HCV RNA 12 weeks after diagnosis\\nof acute HCV (NEAT 2010). With early treatment consisting of pegylated interferon\\nand ribavirin response rates of about 70% (80% in genotype 2/3) can be achieved.\\nEarly discontinuation of dual therapy is justified in persons experiencing significant\\nside effects. Enrollment of persons with acute HCV coinfection in ongoing trials\\nusing interferon-free DAA combination therapy is strongly encouraged. \\nTreatment of chronic hepatitis C\\nThe goal of hepatitis C treatment is to achieve permanently negative HCV RNA levels.\\nThis is generally referred to as a “sustained virological response” (SVR). It is defined\\nas a negative HCV RNA 12 to 24 weeks after completion of treatment.\\nNegative HCV RNA at the end of the treatment period is described as “end of treat-\\nment response” (ETR). If transaminases have normalized, this is referred to as a bio-\\nchemical response. However, the latter does not correlate with the clinical course of\\nhepatitis C. Failure to respond to treatment is referred to as a non-response. In the\\nfollowing text, response rates always refer to sustained responses. Only sustained\\nresponses have been clearly associated with resolution of liver fibrosis and extra-\\nhepatic manifestations, as well as with the prevention of further transmission.

The probability of a relapse is highest within the first months following com-\\npletion of treatment and decreases steadily afterwards. Therefore, the success of\\ntherapy is usually determined and evaluated 12–24 weeks after the end of treatment.\\nTreatment indication\\nAchieving SVR has been associated with an improved survival even in earlier fibro-\\nsis stages (F2) suggesting benefits of HCV therapy beyond cure of HCV and preven-\\ntion of further liver disease progression. Therefore, every person with co-infection\\nshould be considered for treatment when the benefits of therapy outweigh the risks\\nincluding patients pre- or post-liver transplantation particularly in the light of better\\nHCV treatment outcomes with the use of DAAs in these persons. Thus HIV coin-\\nfection gives a high priority to anti-HCV treatment already at lower liver fibrosis\\nstages (F0/F1). In case of the availability of a liver biopsy or FibroScan\\n® demonstrat-\\ning lack of or minimal liver fibrosis (F0-1), regardless of HCV GT, treatment can be\\ndeferred, however, in countries where no or only limited DAAs have become avail-\\nable so far or where cost reimbursement issues still have not been clarified. In these\\ncases, fibrosis assessment should be carried out every 12 months periodically to\\nmonitor for fibrosis progression.\\nIf chronic HCV and HIV infection are newly diagnosed at the same time and CD4\\ncell count is >500 cells/µl treatment of HCV in the presence of immediate HCV treat-\\nment indication (\\n/H11350F2 fibrosis) can be considered prior to ART initiation to avoid\\npotential drug-drug interactions between ART and HCV DAAs. \\nTreatment regimen\\nThe combination of sofosbuvir 400 mg QD and a weight-adjusted dose of ribavirin\\nof 1000 (<75 kg) to 1200 (>75 kg) mg/day BID for 12 weeks has become the new gold\\nstandard therapy for all HCV GT2 persons, promising cure in >90%. Persons with\\ncirrhosis can be treated for an extended duration of 16 weeks. The approval of further\\nDAAs have offered the opportunity of interferon- and partially also ribavirin-free\\nDAA combination regimens which because of significantly improved tolerability and\\nhigher HCV cure rates can now be considered the gold standard in HCV therapy. In\\nparticular, the combinations of sofosbuvir and simeprevir (GT1/4), a fixed-dose com-\\nbination of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (GT1/4), sofosbuvir and daclatasvir (GT1/2/3/4) or\\na combination of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/r and dasabuvir (GT1, GT4 without dasabu-\\nvir) are recommended (see Table 2). Addition of ribavirin may be considered to reduce\\nrelapse rate and shorten treatment duration for some of the DAA combinations.\\nRibavirin should also be added to the ombitasvir/paritaprevir/r and dasabuvir com-\\nbination when treating GT1a and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/r when treating GT4.\\nUse of older, first generation HCV PIs (boceprevir and telaprevir, only indicated in\\nGT1) is no longer recommended because of increased toxicities.

Up\\nto 95% of all HIV+ patients have been infected with hepatitis B, and approximately\\n10–15% have chronic hepatitis B, with considerable variation among geographical\\nregions and risk groups (Alter 2006, Konopnicki 2005). It is estimated that around\\n100,000 HIV+ patients in the US suffer from chronic hepatitis B. Due to implemen-\\ntation of vaccination programs in many countries transmission rates decrease,\\n especially in the younger population. Sexual transmission is the most frequent route\\nof transmission. Transmission via the bloodstream is more likely than for HIV:\\n following a needle stick injury contaminated with HBV-infected blood, the risk of\\ninfection is around 30% (HCV <2%; HIV approximately 0.3%).\\nAcute HBV infection leads to chronic hepatitis in 2-5% of immunocompetent adults,\\nwhereas HIV+ patients experience chronicity about five times more often. A possi-\\nble reason for this is the HIV-associated immunodeficiency, whereas virus-specific\\nfactors such as hepatitis B viral load and genotype do not contribute significantly\\n(Bodsworth 1991).\\nHepatitis B and HIV share several features, although hepatitis B is a non-integrating,\\ncircular DNA virus (“closed circular supercoiled” DNA [cccDNA]). Hepatitis B is one\\nof a few known non-retroviral viruses which uses reverse transcription as a part of\\nits replication process. Therefore, replication can be inhibited with NRTIs. Although\\nelimination can basically be achieved by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), it has to\\nbe assumed that hepatitis B virus DNA will persist life-long in most patients. Therefore\\nreactivation can occur after many years, e.g., due to immunosuppression in advanced\\nHIV infection or following chemotherapy, regardless of the pattern of antibodies found.\\nHBV diagnosis methods in HIV+ patients do not differ from negative patients. Table 1\\nsummarizes the interpretation of serological test results. HBV screening of HIV+\\npatients starts with HBsAg, anti-HBs, and anti-HBc. If a positive HBsAg is found,\\ntesting for HBeAg, anti-HBe, and HBV DNA should follow.\\nThe isolated presence of anti-HBc in the absence of HBsAg and anti-HBs (so called\\n“anti-HBc only”) is found quite frequently in HIV+ patients (less than 2% in healthy\\nblood donors). Three situations should be considered: 1) early phase of an acute\\n hepatitis B, 2) many years after recovery from acute hepatitis B when anti-HBs has\\nfallen to undetectable levels, or 3) after many years of chronic HBV infection when\\nthe HBsAg titer has decreased to below the cutoff level for detection. Clinical\\n significance of this state has not been clearly defined. In most instances, it will be a\\nloss of anti-HBs without any clinical consequence.\\nTable 1: Interpretation of serological test results for HBV\\nInterpretation HBsAg anti-HBs anti-HBc HBeAg anti-HBe HBV DNA\\nNo prior contact with HBV – –––––\\nAcute infection + – + (IgM) + – +\\nPast infection with immunity – + + (IgG) – + –\\nChronic hepatitis B + – + (IgG) + – +\\nLatent/occult infection\\n1 – – +/– (IgG) – – +\\nPre-core mutant + – + (IgG) – + +\\nInactive carrier state + – + (IgG) – + –\\nImmunity after vaccination – +––––\\n1 Controversial.

Prevalence and clinical impact in coinfection is still unclear.\\nPatients with chronic hepatitis B should be tested for hepatitis D infection also.\\nIn general, not only cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis B should be screened\\nfor hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but also HBV/HIV coinfected patients with high\\nrisk for HCC occurrence such as Asian or black decent, family history of HCC, NAFLD,\\nand replicating HBV infection. Screening should be performed every 6 months by\\nultrasound of the liver as 10 to 30% of patients who develop HCC do not have pre-\\nexisting cirrhosis.\\nCourse of hepatitis B with concurrent HIV infection\\nThe course of hepatitis B is negatively influenced by HIV infection. Liver-associated\\nmortality is about 15 times higher than in HIV-negative patients (Thio 2002,\\nKonopnicki 2005). In addition, HIV coinfection accelerates the progression of hep-\\natitis B and increases the risk of cirrhosis. Entanglement between the profibrogenic\\neffect of HIV itself and the alteration by HIV of innate and adaptive immune\\nresponses to HBV has been elucidated further in recent years (e.g., direct cytopathic\\neffect on liver tissue by CCR5-mediated activation of hepatic stellate cells and hepa-\\ntocytes; indirect upregulation of pro-inflammatory and apoptotic factors). Despite\\nthese unfavorable effects, the clinical course appears initially usually more benign\\nin HIV+ patients, although viral replication is increased. This seems contradictory\\nat first, but can be explained by the impairment of cellular immunity, which may\\nlead to an increase in viral replication, but at the same time also reduces hepatocyte\\ndamage. Therefore, transaminases in HBV/HIV-coinfected patients are frequently\\nonly mildly increased. In contrast, HBV DNA, as a marker for viral replication, is\\nhigher than in immunocompetent patients. Accordingly, despite less inflammatory\\nactivity, liver fibrosis and cirrhosis are more common. This phenomenon can be\\nobserved in other groups of patients with immunosuppression, e.g., organ transplant\\npatients.\\nThere is a direct correlation between the extent of immunosuppression and the\\ncontrol of viral replication of HBV. Patients with apparently resolved hepatitis B (anti-\\nHBe-positive, HBV DNA-negative) and increasing deterioration of the immune\\nsystem may result in a reactivation of the HBV infection (Soriano 2005). Notably,\\nsome cases of reactivation of hepatitis B have been described following immune\\nreconstitution after initiation of ART.\\nHIV/HBV coinfection possibly has also a negative impact on the course of HIV infec-\\ntion. An increase of overall mortality and AIDS-defining events has been described\\n(Nikolopoulos 2009, Chun 2012). Moreover, the risk for ART-related hepatotoxicity\\nis about three times higher. \\nWhether or not the prognosis of coinfected patients is changed by effective thera-\\npies for ART and HBV remains to be seen. According to some studies, a reduction in\\nHBV-associated mortality is associated with effective treatment of HBV (e.g., French\\nGERMIVIC cohort) (Puoti 2007, Rosenthal 2009).\\nPrevention\\nAll HIV+ patients with negative hepatitis B serology should be vaccinated. The\\nvaccine may, however, be less effective due to immunosuppression. Approximately\\n30% of HIV+ patients have a primary non-response (only 2.5% in immunocompe-\\ntent individuals). The response to the vaccine is influenced by the CD4 T cell count\\nand level of HIV RNA. Patients with CD4 T cell counts of less than 200/µl who are\\n462 Other Infections than HIV-1'),\n",

Double dose revaccination (40 mg) at 3–4\\nvaccination timepoints (months 0, 1, 6 and 12) may help to improve vaccination\\nresponse rates (Fonseca 2005, Launay 2011). \\nLoss of protective immunity is seen in up to 30% of patients each year following\\nseroconversion. Therefore, anti-HBs should be monitored once a year and consider-\\nation given to booster doses if anti-HBs antibody levels are less than 100 IU/l. HIV\\npatients, who are not adequately immunized against HBV should be screened yearly\\nfor newly acquired infection. \\nOf note, recent studies have demonstrated that HBV-active ART protects against the\\noccurrence of de novo HBV infection, most strongly when tenofovir is used (Heuft\\n2014). This could therefore also be a strategy in patients who do not seem to respond\\nto HBV vaccination. \\nHIV/HBV-coinfected patients who are seronegative for hepatitis A should be vacci-\\nnated (months 0 and 6), as there is an increased rate of severe or fulminant hepati-\\ntis in case of acute hepatitis A. Patients who are susceptible to both hepatitis A and\\nB can be vaccinated with a bivalent vaccine (months 0, 1, and 6).\\nFollowing immunization, patients should be counseled about common measures to\\nprevent further transmission and transmission of other viruses such as hepatitis C\\n(safer sex practices, avoidance of needle sharing, etc). They should also be educated\\nabout strategies to prevent progression of liver disease such as avoidance of alcohol\\nconsumption, tobacco use (controversial), or herbal supplements, many of which\\nare hepatotoxic. The application of hepatotoxic drugs (e.g., antituberculous agents)\\nshould be carried out cautiously.\\nNewborns of mothers with chronic hepatitis B should receive hepatitis B-immuno -\\nglobulin and active immunization.\\nTreatment\\nIn HBV/HIV-coinfected patients, loss of HBsAg with development of protective anti-\\nHBs antibodies is difficult to achieve because of impaired immune function. Realistic\\ntreatment goals are seroconversion from HBeAg to anti-HBe, a complete suppression\\nof HBV DNA, normalization of transaminases, improvement of liver histology, and\\nprevention of hepatocellular carcinoma. Other benefits of HBV therapy include a\\nreduction in the risk of transmission and possibly in the risk of ART-induced hepa-\\ntotoxicity. As mentioned above, HBV-associated mortality is likely to improve also.\\nDrugs with HBV activity\\nPossible treatment options for hepatitis B are nucleoside analogs, nucleotide analogs\\nand interferon (see Table 2). Tenofovir, active against both HIV and HBV , is the most\\nimportant drug. All other drugs play a less significant role today.\\nBesides tenofovir, 3TC, FTC, and entecavir are active against both HBV and HIV.\\nDrugs with activity against HBV only are adefovir and telbivudine.

More than 95% of patients treated\\nwith tenofovir have viral suppression after 5 years.

The frequency of resistance develop-\\nment has been reported to be at least 20% of patients per year. Cross-resistance exists\\nbetween 3TC, FTC, entecavir, and telbivudine. This can be overcome only partially\\nwith an increase in dose (e.g., entecavir has to be administered with a higher dose\\nfollowing treatment with 3TC). Although the nucleotide analog adefovir has a dif-\\nferent mechanism of resistance development, selection of the A181T mutation with\\nongoing viral replication has been described.\\nIt is reasonable to assume that combination of two drugs active against HBV will\\nenhance antiviral activity and delay the selection of HBV resistance.

Lower dosages only apply when concomitant HIV is\\ntreated with an independent, self-sufficient ART regimen. If TDF is strictly con-\\ntraindicated, entecavir plus adefovir can be considered. However, efficacy and renal\\ntoxicity need to be closely monitored, because of the proven renal toxicity of ade-\\nfovir. In persons with no prior 3TC exposure, entecavir may be used alone. NRTI\\nsubstitution should only be performed if feasible and appropriate from the perspec-\\ntive of maintaining HIV suppression. Caution is warranted when switching from a\\nTDF-based regimen to drugs with a lower genetic barrier, e.g., FTC or 3TC, in par-\\nticular in 3TC-pretreated cirrhotic persons as viral breakthrough due to archived\\nYMDD mutations is likely to happen.

Human Pegivirus HPgV Infection\\n(formerly GB virus C/Hepatitis G virus)\\nMATTHIAS STOLL\\nHippocrates (5th century BC) was the first to postulate that signs of inflammation\\nrepresent both a symptom of disease and as well as a hint of its cure. Edward Jenner\\n(18th century) demonstrated that an artificial infection with a harmless cowpox is\\nable to prevent the dangerous smallpox. William Coley (19th century) prevented\\nprogress of malignancies by bacterial toxins (Coley 1893). In 1927 the Nobel Prize\\nfor Medicine was awarded to the Austrian neurologist Julius Wagner von Jauregg,\\nwho was able to obtain improvement in patients with late stage symptomatic\\n neurosyphilis by infecting them with the malaria parasite. Thus, infectious diseases\\nmay result in harm reduction under certain conditions: Immunomodulatory effects\\nand direct interactions between the causative microoorganisms of infection and\\n coinfection have been postulated to be the beneficial effector mechanisms.\\nHuman pegivirus (HPgV) is a flavivirus closely related to hepatitis C virus (Stapleton\\n2011, Adams 2013). Its former name GB virus (GBV-C) stems from early experiments\\non the transmission of acute hepatitis from humans to marmosets. One of the first\\nsource patients had the initials “G.B.” (Deinhardt 1967). Later on, two hepatotropic\\nviruses, GB virus A (GBV-A) and GB virus B (GBV-B), were isolated from marmosets.\\nTwo research groups simultaneously discovered the related human pegivirus in\\nhumans with hepatitis in the mid-90s. Subsequently, HPgV has promoted a discus-\\nsion as to whether the natural course of HIV infection might be modulated in a\\nfavorable way by this particular coinfection. In addition, because HPgV was first\\nfound in humans with hepatitis, and due to its close relationship to GBV-A and GBV-\\nB in marmosets, human pegivirus/GBV-C was also named “hepatitis G virus (HGV)”\\nby one research group. However, it has been shown that HPgV neither causes  hepatitis\\nnor worsens preexisting hepatitis (Berenguer 1996, Tillmann 1998, Rambusch 1998,\\nStark 1999). Whether viremia is increased in lymphoma patients without HIV\\n infection, is debated (Krajden 2009, Ernst 2014). \\nAlthough the primary permissive cell type of HPgV has not yet been identified, the\\nvirus has been found in lymphocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, bone\\nmarrow, liver, and spleen (Chivero 2015). HPgV has until yet not been shown to\\ncause any known disease in humans but a couple of studies indicated a more\\nfavourable course of HIV-, HCV-, and more recently Ebolavirus-associated diseases\\n(Lauck 2015) in those individuals chronically coinfected with HPgV. \\nPrevalence studies revealed HPgV viremia within the general population ranging\\nfrom less than 5% in industrialized countries up to more than 15% in some devel-\\noping countries. Although approximately 10% to 30% of blood donors have specific\\nantibodies against HPgV , affected individuals are not excluded from the donation of\\nblood, assuming that the virus is apathogenic. Consequently, serological diagnostics\\non HPgV are not routinely performed. An estimated 25% of HPgV-infections persist,\\nand the other 75% clear viremia within two years of infection (Gutierrez 1997; Tanaka\\n1998). Two serological markers for HPgV infection exist: HPgV viremia can be deter-\\nmined using a PCR method; and antibodies to the envelope region E2 (anti-E2) are\\ndetected by ELISA (Table 1). As they are mutually exclusive, either HPgV viremia or\\nthe presence of anti-E2 is detectable in HPgV infected individuals (Gutierrez 1997;\\nTanaka 1998). HPgV viremia may persist for decades but in the majority HPgV viremia\\nis transient and ends with seroconversion to anti-E2, resulting in immunity to new\\ninfections. However, this does not seem to be a lifelong immunity (Table 1).\\n467'),\n",

These bene-\\nficial effects were confirmed by different research groups (Lefrère 1999, Yeo 2000,\\nTillmann 2001, Xiang 2001) and were also seen in antiretrovirally treated HIV+ indi-\\nviduals (Tillmann 2004+2006, Nunnari 2003, Williams 2004, Ernst 2011). The mod-\\nulatory effects were associated to persisting HPgV viremia but were not present in\\nthose without or with cleared HPgV infection. A meta-analysis described an improved\\nresponse to ART and clinical benefit for HIV/HPgV coinfected patients, which was\\nmore pronounced with longer follow-up (Zhang 2006). \\nConflicting results came from some studies (review: Battharai 2012), which did not\\nfind an effect of HPgV viremia on HIV infection (Sabin 1998, Birk 2002, Bjorkman\\n2004, van der Bij 2005), including two studies in women (Kaye 2005, Williams 2005).\\nOne of these studies summarized viremic and anti-E2-positive patients as HPgV pos-\\nitive group (Sabin 1998). Another study focused on HPgV viremia at study entry (van\\nder Bij 2005). In this study the subgroup with persistent HPgV RNA had a superior\\nclinical outcome. A less pronounced potential gender-specific modulating effect of\\nHPgV on HIV in women may exist (Kaye 2005, Williams 2005). Another study on\\nHIV+ pregnant women found a lower HIV viral load in HPgV viremic mothers and\\nless vertical HIV transmission in the HAART era but not in the pre-HAART era\\n(Handelsman 2008). The lower risk for vertical transmission of HIV seems to be asso-\\nciated with replicative HPgV infection in the child rather than by HPgV status of the\\nmother. Surprisingly the risk for vertical transmission of HPgV was found to be\\nincreased under HAART in HIV/HPgV coinfected pregnant women (Bhanich-Supapol\\n2009). In addition, there is evidence from a multicenter trial, that HPgV genotype 2\\ncoinfection was associated with higher CD4 T cell counts (Schwarze-Zander 2006).\\nThis may explain regional differences and at least in part conflicting results from\\ncohort studies from different regions.\\nIn summary, most studies found more pronounced antiretroviral and immunologi-\\ncal effects in ART-treated HPgV RNA positive patients. However, other studies did\\nnot find any difference. No study to date described a negative influence of HPgV\\nviremia on the effect of ART. \\n468 Other Infections than HIV-1'),\n",

However, a negative impact of interferon was not seen in a large multicenter\\ntrial (Schwarze-Zander 2006).  \\nProposed pathomechanisms \\nUp to now, the fundamental chicken or egg dilemma remains unsolved: whether\\nHPgV viremia is an epiphenomenon or the cause for an improved outcome of HIV\\ninfection. A major drawback of the first studies was the lack of any pathophysiologic\\nconcept. Meanwhile many different hypotheses have been postulated about direct\\ninhibitory effects of HPgV on HIV replication, about competition of both viruses at\\ncertain steps of action during the replication cycle, and about immunomodulatory\\nmechanisms in the host induced by HPgV. After more than two decades of research,\\nit has been shown that more than one way leads to Rome. The knowledge about the\\npathophysiology of HPgV coinfection in HIV looks rather like a varied bunch of\\npleiotropic effects of numerous different modes of (inter-)action. The modulating\\neffects of HPgV on HIV disease (Table 3) have be explained by attachment or entry\\ninhibition, downregulation of CD4- and chemokine receptors including upregula-\\ntion of their ligands, enhancement of innate immunity, downregulation of immune\\nactivation and apoptosis, and modulation of T cell responses. \\nThe elucidation of the underlying molecular pathomechanisms is still fragmentary.\\nHowever, HPgV treads several independent pathways, using E2-protein, NS5A-\\nprotein, and Anti-E2-antibodies. Hence it might be speculated, that mankind shares\\na long coevolution together with HPgV and retroviruses, which could explain why\\nHIV – in contrast to SIV in other primates – until recently was not able to establish\\na stable endemic. \\nHuman Pegivirus HPgV Infection    469'),\n",

On the other side periodical\\nepidemics of pox might have killed efficiently any human host of HIV , because a\\nfatal course in pox is common especially in cases with preexisting cellular immun-\\nodeficiency. The possible result of this two competing coinfections: HIV was – until\\nrecently – not able to establish a stable endemic in humans over a long time.\\nThe story of HPgV coinfection in HIV started with observational epidemiology and\\nrevealed an unexpected clinical observation: HPgV presents as a non-pathogenic\\nvirus in humans and as a beneficial coinfection in HIV+ individuals. At this point\\nscience started at bedside and went to bench in the last two decades. A puzzling\\ndiversity of pathomechanisms had been described meanwhile and may have raised\\nmore questions than answers. For more detailed information to the complex role of\\nHPgV in the pathophysiology of HIV-infection it is referred to recent reviews of the\\nscientific literature in this evolving field of infectiology (Bhattarai 2012a, Chiveiro\\n2015, Maidana Giret 2012, Schwarze-Zander 2012, Shankar 2011). \\nHow to deal with HPgV coinfection in clinical practice?\\nBeyond the tales of a potentially beneficial infection the impact of HPg-Virus may\\nbe in understanding the pathophysiology of virus to virus- and virus to host-inter-\\nactions rather than in a hypothetical role in clinical practice: \\n1. Until now it is not recommended to test HIV+ patients for their HPgV serostatus\\nnor for HPgV replication by PCR beyond clinical studies. But some authors claim\\nsuch tools for clinical practice (Battharai 2012b). \\n2. HIV+ patients should be informed that – at least in adults (Tenckhoff 2012) – there\\nis no evidence that (an artificial) HPgV infection, which happens after HIV sero-\\nconversion will be of benefit in the course of HIV infection. It cannot be predicted\\nwhether an infection with HPgV will remain chronically replicative. Coinfections\\nwith HPgV in an in vitro model show evidence for an inhibition of HIV replication\\nwhen HPgV infection occurs before HIV infection but not later (Xiang 2001). In addi-\\ntion the substantial risks of any mucosal or parenteral inoculation with infectious\\nmaterials from human sources should be considered carefully. \\n3. There is no evidence to support the deferral of HCV therapy in HIV/HCV/HPgV\\ncoinfected patients, although interferon therapy can terminate chronic HPgV repli-\\ncation. Whether DAAs may be as well active against the closely related flavivirus\\nHPgV must be elucidated by further ( in vitro)studies.  \\nWe are still in the early stages of HPgV history. Over the last two decades we have\\naccrued some fascinating insights into possible mechanisms of HIV and HPgV inter-\\naction and the roles that individual host factors may play. At present, HPgV gives us\\nthe opportunity to obtain insight into clinically relevant regulation pathways of HIV.\\nThis may help us develop auxiliary therapeutic concepts. These concepts may be\\nboth clinically and therapeutically promising because an additional benefit of HPgV\\nremains evident in several studies after the initiation of ART.\\nReferences\\nAdams MJ, King AM, Carstens EB.

HIV and Sexually Transmitted Diseases\\nSTEFAN ESSER\\nEpidemiology \\nA sexually transmitted infection (STI) or disease (STD) seldom occurs in isolation,\\nwithout other STIs. STIs can contribute to the transmission of HIV or other venereal\\ninfections. In the case of an STI, the sexual partners of the patient should be informed,\\nexamined, and treated, if necessary.\\nRarely, HIV RNA and proviral DNA can also be detected in genito-anal secretions\\nand fluids of successfully ART treated HIV+ patients especially when they are coin-\\nfected with other STIs. The influence of the STIs on genito-anal HIV shedding seems\\nto be different (Potlich 2012, Storim 2015, Kelley 2015, Rosenberg 2015). Therefore,\\ntesting and treatment of STIs can reduce the risk of HIV transmissions. \\nThe incidence and prevalence of STIs and STDs are on the increase. For example, the\\nincidence of syphilis has been increasing in Western Europe and the US since the\\nend of the 90s. In patients with newly diagnosed syphilis infections in Germany, the\\nprevalence of HIV infection is approximately 45% (RKI 2010). In recent years, there\\nhave also been reports of regional epidemics of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV)\\nin Europe, which had been regarded as an STI mainly in the tropics and subtropics.\\nMen having sex with men (MSM) are particularly affected (in more than 90% of cases\\nof LGV , and more than 60% of cases of syphilis). HIV+ persons seem to be more vul-\\nnerable to some STDs (RKI 2004+2005). \\nHuman papilloma virus (HPV) is among the most frequent sexually transmitted\\npathogens in woman as well as men. Usually self-limiting in otherwise healthy\\npeople, HPV infections may persist in HIV+ patients more often and can cause condy-\\nlomata acuminata and precancerous intraepithelial neoplasia. Over time chronic\\nhigh risk HPV-type infection can result in malignancies such as cervical or anal\\n carcinoma. In spite of the use of antiretroviral treatment the incidence of HPV-asso-\\nciated cancers is much more frequent in HIV+ patients than in the general population.\\nAlso infections like hepatitis C (Larson 2011, Obermeier 2011) and shigella (RKI 2005,\\nAragón 2007, Daskalakis 2007), usually not preferentially sexually transmitted, have\\naccumulated regionally in HIV+ MSM in some large German cities linked with certain\\nsexual practices. \\nThe incidence of STDs increases more rapidly in HIV+ persons. Screenings in differ-\\nent countries find a high prevalence of asymptomatic sexually transmitted coinfec-\\ntions in HIV+ cohorts (Heiligenberg 2012). MSM in cities still practice high-risk sexual\\nbehaviours frequently (Dirks 2011, Mayer 2012). STI screening in HIV+ persons\\nshould be performed routinely (RKI 2010, Esser 2011, Heiligenberg 2012, Mayer\\n2012). STDs are HIV indicator diseases (Sullivan 2011). All STD patients not known\\nto be HIV-positive should be offered an HIV test. Condoms are still the best method\\nto reduce the transmission risk of all STIs but the protection is not 100%. \\nFollowing is a detailed description of the most important STDs. Sexually transmit-\\nted diseases like hepatitis B as well as herpes simplex or bacterial vaginoses will be\\ndescribed in other sections of this book.\\nReferences\\nAragón TJ, Vugia DJ, Shallow S, et al.

The bacteria are mainly transmitted by direct sexual contact with infected\\npersons, and penetrate into the organism through microlesions in the mucosa or the\\nskin. Even kissing can cause an infection. In the case of unprotected sexual contact,\\nthe risk of transmission ranges from 30 to 60%. Hematogenous or congenital trans-\\nmissions very seldomly occur in western countries.\\nClinical course\\nThe incubation period is usually 14 to 24 days. Approximately 40 to 50% of infec-\\ntions show no symptoms or are self-limiting. Persistent infections may affect various\\norgan systems, going through stages of the course of the disease. However, these\\nstages can be skipped or repeated. The highest risk of transmission is during the clin-\\nical symptomatic stages of early syphilis (primary and secondary syphilis), especially\\nin case of a primary lesion in stage I. During the late latency period (>1–2 years after\\ninfection) and the clinically symptomatic late stages (tertiary syphilis: 2–50 years\\npost infection) syphilis is considered to be non-infectious.\\nPrimary syphilis: 2–3 weeks after infection the primary lesion with ulcus durum\\n(hard chancre, erosive chancre) appears at the site of inoculation. This indolent,\\nsturdy ulcer with infiltrated borders usually yields a clear treponema-rich exudate\\nwhen compressed or squeezed. The chancre is accompanied by a usually strong  one-\\nsided lymphadenitis, swelling of the lymph nodes. This primary complex will spon-\\ntaneously resolve after 4 to 6 weeks without treatment.\\nHIV and Sexually Transmitted Diseases    475'),\n",

Even an ocular involvement manifesting as episcleritis or\\niritis can be seen in secondary syphilis. The clinical variety of the frequent syphilids\\non the skin or the mucous membranes varies from exanthema (usually with\\n palmoplantar participation) to roseola, alopecia syphilitica, moist papule, angina\\nspecifica, to condylomata lata (genital and perianal) as well as pigment changes\\n(leukoderma specificum) and lues maligna. Headaches at night are a sign of an early\\nsyphilitic meningitis cerebrospinalis. \\nLatent syphilis: When the infection is brought under control by the immune system\\nthe clinical features usually disappear entirely. However, during this latency period,\\nsyphilis remains serologically detectable and a relapse or progression is possible.\\nDuring the early latency period (<1–2 years after infection) the syphilis can still be\\ntransmitted by blood.\\nTertiary syphilis: Years after primary infection, the so-called gummata may appear.\\nThese can affect any organ, showing tuberous or granulomatous changes with a ten-\\ndency to ulceration and cicatricial healing. Major cardiovascular features of tertiary\\nsyphilis are asymptomatic aortitis, aortic insufficiency, coronary ostial stenosis and\\naortic aneurysm. Tertiary syphilis of the central nervous system (CNS) has many\\nmanifestations, involving the meninges and the arteries and parenchyma of the cere-\\nbral cortex. Meningovascular syphilis is characterized by an obliterative endarteritis\\nof the meningeal vessels with subsequent arterial thrombosis and ischemic necrosis\\nin the brain and spinal cord. Strokes are observed even in young patients with per-\\nsistent untreated syphilis infection. \\nQuarternary syphilis: In untreated patients, a late neurosyphilis occurs in various\\nforms after some years. In case of tabes dorsalis, a shooting and burning pain, sensory\\nataxia, reflective pupilloplegia (signs of Argyll Robertson syndrome) and optic\\natrophy are observed. Regarding syphilitic meningitis, cranial nerve paresis, an\\nincrease of intracranial pressure and other neurological symptoms are seen. In case\\nof progressive paralysis symptoms like headache and a change in personality prevail\\nfollowed by dysplasia (a speech disorder), cramps, dementia and apoplectic attacks.\\nAn untreated progressive paralysis will lead to death in 4 to 5 years.\\nConnatal/Congenital Syphilis: Diaplacental transmission usually happens in the\\n4th to 5th month of pregnancy. Depending on the stage of syphilis in a pregnant\\nwoman, it will lead to an abortion or a lues connata of the infant, progressing in the\\nfollowing ways: Lues connata praecox, rhinitis syphilitica, interstitial hepatitis,\\nencephalomeniningitis with hydrocephalus communicans hypersecretorius as well\\nas Parrot’s pseudoparalysis. The typical stigmata of lues connata tarda(from the age\\nof 3) are saddle nose, Parrot’s ulcer and Hutchinson’s triad: Hutchinson’s teeth, ker-\\natitis parenchymatosa and labyrinthine deafness.\\nIn HIV+ patients, unusual manifestations and fulminant progress of syphilis are often\\nobserved (Gregory 1990). Reactivation of earlier infections as well as shorter latency\\nperiods and faster progression to the later stages including neurosyphilis occur in\\naddition to symptoms of the coexistent stages. Neurosyphilis can be diagnosed in\\nabout 20% of syphilis/HIV-coinfected patients during the early syphilis stages (Esser\\n2011). Syphilis can lead to a temporary increase in HIV viral load and to an addi-\\ntional deterioration of the immune status even in patients on effective ART. \\n476 Other Infections than HIV-1'),\n",

A direct microscopic viral detection\\nshould be done when a primary syphilis lesion is suspected, particularly in the case\\nof an initially prevailing seronegativity. As a first reaction, IgM antibodies will appear\\n(diagnostic test and lipoid antibody detection will still be negative).\\nDue to a possible overlap of disease stages, each serologically syphilis-positive patient\\nshould be neurologically examined. As the risk for neurosyphilis is markedly\\nincreased in HIV+ patients, a lumbar puncture to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is\\nrecommended when the patient has low CD4 cells (<350 cells/µl) or high viral loads\\n(HIV RNA >100,000 copies/ml) or is not on antiretroviral treatment or shows neu-\\nrological symptoms or ocular involvement or the time of infection is not certain\\n(DSTIG 2014, Ghanem 2008, Marra 2004).\\nDiagnostic findings in the CSF and neurological symptoms may have therapeutic\\nconsequences (see below). Interpretation of CSF results in HIV+ patients should be\\ndone by experts on the basis of the ITPA index (intrathecal-produced Treponema\\n pallidum antibodies), parameters of a cerebrovascular barrier disorder and the detec-\\ntion of lymphomonocytic pleocytosis.\\nInterpretation of syphilis serology in HIV-infected patients\\nSyphilis serology is based in principle on treponema-specific diagnostic tests. These\\nare TPHA ( Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay), TPPA ( Treponema pallidum\\nparticle agglutination test), or ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). If pos-\\nitive, treponema-specific tests to confirm will follow, like IgM ELISA, IgM and IgG\\nWestern Blot or 19-S-IgM-FTA-ABS (treponemal antibody-absorption test). In the case\\nof a reactive 19-s-IgM-FTA-ABS test in untreated patients or a reactivation of the test\\nin treated patients (Lues non satis curate), there is always need for treatment.\\nFalse-negative test results can be explained by inadequate production of antibodies\\nor by suppression of IgM production due to high IgG levels. When in doubt, spe-\\ncific tests such as FTA-ABS or cardiolipin tests should be carried out, even though\\nfalse-negative results may occur again. Should a syphilis infection be serologically\\nconfirmed, a quantitative evaluation of the non-treponema specific activity param-\\neters (lipoid antibodies, e.g., VDRL test or KBR) is required. The prozone phenome-\\nnon refers to a false-negative response resulting from disproportionately high anti-\\nbody titers that interfere with the formation of antigen-antibody lattice necessary\\nto visualize a positive flocculation test. This effect can be expected during second-\\nary syphilis and in syphilis/HIV-coinfected patients (Smith 2004). HIV-associated\\nunspecific activation of B lymphocytes can also cause false positive VDRL tests.\\nPossibly quantitative Treponema pallidum PCR may facilitate the diagnosis and mon-\\nitoring of the course in syphilis patients. \\nThe longer a patient has untreated syphilis the longer the normalisation of the\\nsyphilis activity parameters will take even after a successful syphilis therapy in HIV+\\npatients. The IgM test may remain reactive for years. A successful therapy during this\\nIgM-reactive period is indicated by a clear titer decrease of the non-treponema-spe-\\ncific activity parameters (reduction of VDRL by at least 2 titer levels within 3 months).\\nHIV and Sexually Transmitted Diseases    477'),\n",

The\\nbacterium can be found worldwide and depending on the region shows a varying\\nand changing resistance profile. Gonorrhea is typically localized in the genitouri-\\nnary mucosa and transmission is almost exclusively through sexual activity (excep-\\ntion: neonatal conjunctivitis); the incubation period lasts from 2 to 10 days.\\nClinical course\\nThe primary symptoms in men are urethritis, frequent strangury, a burning pain\\nwhen urinating, and urethral pain. A typical symptom is the bonjour drop, a puru-\\nlent discharge from the urethra after several hours of restricted micturition. It is often\\naccompanied by a strangury. Without treatment, gonorrhea can cause prostatitis.\\nSymptoms are a burning after miction, pain in the intestinal area and an enlarge-\\nment of the prostate. Furthermore, it can cause an epididymitis with pain and\\nswelling. \\nIn women, the course of gonorrhea is often asymptomatic, although urethritis may\\noccur. Only in pre-pubescent girls is a vaginal colonization possible. Involvement of\\nthe cervix and adnexa of the uterus may cause complications like peritonitis and\\npelvic inflammatory disease.\\nExtra-genital manifestations of gonorrhea occasionally cause pharyngitis or procti-\\ntis. Perinatal transmission of gonococcal conjunctiva is rare. Which is why Credé’s\\nprophylaxis for newborns (temporary treatment with eye drops: originally 1% silver\\nnitrate solution; later, erythromycin-containing eye drops or ointments) was stopped\\nin Germany. Systemic infections with general symptoms like fever, arthritis and endo-\\ncarditis including gonococcal sepsis are rare (Rompalo 1987). Coinfections with other\\nSTI are frequent in patients with gonorrhea (Abraham 2013).\\nDiagnosis\\nThe most sensitive and specific detection method of Neisseria gonorrhoeae is the PCR\\nor nucleic acid amplification test. Usually genitourethral infections are diagnosed by\\nPCR detection in the urine. The PCR gives no information about the resistance status\\nof the infections agent.

At the same time, a reduced response to quinolones by up to 24%\\nwas detected in the US (CDC 1998). Penicillinase-producing (resistant) gonococcal\\nstains are seen in the US in 25%, in Asia 30%, and in Africa up to 90%. Also an\\nincrease of resistance to 3\\nrd generation cephalosporins has been observed in many\\nregions (Bala 2010, Ison 2010, Chisholm 2011). Resistance to ceftriaxone has been\\nreported (Carnicer-Pont 2012, Unemo 2011) as well as to macrolides like\\nazithromycin (Chisholm 2009, Ison 2010). Systematic evaluation of antibiotic resist-\\nance in Germany has not been performed. Gonorrhea is often treated without lab-\\noratory culture and resistance testing. A small German study in the Heidelberg and\\nStuttgart regions with 65 smears from patients with uncomplicated gonorrhea during\\nthe years 2004/2005 (Enders 2006) found resistance to penicillin in 21.5%, to tetra-\\ncyclins in 29.2%, to ciprofloxacin in 47.7% and to azithromycin in 7.7%. All iso-\\nlates were fully susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefixime and spectinomycin, which are\\nno longer available. Comparable results were published in Berlin from 1995 until\\n1997 and from northern parts of Germany from 1997–2000 (Wagner 2001, Ungeheuer\\n2001) looking at 85 isolates.

There are several serotypes that can cause different diseases. \\nSerotypes D-K are broadly distributed in Europe and cause urogenital infections,\\nwhich can be sexually transmitted as well as conjunctivitis or pneumonia after peri-\\nnatal transmission. Serotypes L1, L2 and L3 cause lymphogranuloma venereum\\n(LGV). LGV used to be known strictly as a tropical disease but has undergone a ren-\\naissance in Europe and the US (Gotz 2004, Krosigk 2004).\\nClinical course\\nIn men, symptomatic genital chlamydia, serotypes D-K, may be present as urethritis.\\nAs in gonorrhea, epididymitis, prostatitis or proctitis may occur. Reiter’s syndrome\\nwith conjunctivitis and reactive arthritis is also possible.\\nA chlamydial infection in about 20% of the female patients may manifest as\\n urethritis, cervicitis, salpingitis, endometritis, proctitis and arthritis. Cervicitis\\nmainly contains purulent fluorine. Possible consequences of a salpingitis are steril-\\nity by tubal occlusion or ectopic pregnancy. \\nIn lymphogranuloma venereum caused by serotypes L1-3, a primary lesion occurs\\nat the entry location. Some weeks later a painful swelling of the regional lymph\\nnodes develops that tends to exulcerate. After healing this may lead to scars, which\\nmay cause discharge disorders and fistula due to a blocking in the lymphatic vessels.\\nEspecially in HIV+ MSM, extremely painful and therapy refractory proctitis as well\\nas preanal and intra-anal ulcerations by chlamydial infections with serotypes L1-3\\nmay occur (RKI 2004+2005, Peerenboom 2006). \\nDiagnosis\\nThe best methods to confirm the diagnosis of infection with Chlamydia trachomatis\\nare amplification tests (PCR).

The numerous\\ndifferent HPV subtypes may cause infections in the anogenital region in patients\\nolder than 20. HIV+ patients suffer very often from genito-anal coinfections with\\nvarious oncogene high-risk HPV subtypes. In recent years an increase of HPV-caused\\nbenign fig warts has been observed despite ART as well as intraepithelial neoplasms\\nand carcinoma, both cervical and anal. In immunodeficient patients HPV-associated\\nlesions have low rates of spontaneous remission and are very resistant to therapy\\n(frequent relapses). The risk of developing anal cancer is 80 times higher in HIV+\\nMSM than in the general population. The incidence is 35/100,000 person-years\\n(Chiao 2006, Silverberg 2012). Most HIV+ anal cancer patients have condylomata\\nacuminata in their medical history (Hoffmann 2011). Screening and early treatment\\nof genito-anal condylomata acuminata and intraepithelial neoplasia may reduce the\\nincidence of anal cancer and recommended (DAIG 2013) in HIV+ persons. \\nClinical course\\nMost HPV infections are asymptomatic or subclinical. Even symptomatic HPV infec-\\ntions may end with a spontaneous remission. The clinical manifestations of sexu-\\nally transmitted HPV infections are genito-anal warts or Bowenoid papulosis as well\\nas giant condyloma (Buschke-Lowenstein tumor), cervical or anal intraepithelial neo-\\nplasias (classified CIN or AIN I-III lesions including the erythroplasia of Queyrat) or\\nat least carcinoma. In HIV-infected patients, the risk of persistent HPV infections is\\nseven times higher and correlates inversely with the CD4 T cell count (Piketty 2003).\\nIn HIV+ patients, HPV infections are more often symptomatic and chronic. In addi-\\ntion, the risk of relapse is considerably higher, even after treatment. Malignant trans-\\nformation is the most important complication involving the high-risk HPV subtypes.\\nCondylomata acuminata are hyperkeratotic and verrucous papules of the anogeni-\\ntal region. Condylomata acuminata are usually caused by HPV 6 or HPV 11, so-called\\nlow-risk HPV types, which by themselves do not tend to induce malignant trans-\\nformation.\\nTherefore, fig warts are not inevitably the beginning of genito-anal intraepithelial\\nneoplasms and carcinoma but it is difficult to differentiate between them. Besides\\nthe preferred localization in genital as well as peri- and intra-anal regions, fig warts\\nmay also occur enorally and in the urethra. Condylomata are usually asymptomatic\\nbut can affect the sexual life of patients and may cause hygiene and psychogenic\\nproblems. Pruritus, burning or bleeding are rare and are generally caused by mechan-\\nical stress.\\nDiagnosis\\nAnalogous to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer in women,\\nregular screening (every 1 to 3 years) for condylomata acuminata, anal intraepithe-\\nlial neoplasia (AIN) and anal carcinoma is advised for all HIV+ patients. Screening\\nshould include clinical inspection, palpation, colposcopy, proctoscopy, cytology (Pap\\nsmear) and, if necessary, a histopathological examination of biopsies. Condylomata\\nacuminata is a clinical diagnosis. An exploratory biopsy is recommended before\\ntherapy starts to confirm it is not a malignancy. In case of therapy resistance, early\\nrelapse or a fast or infiltrating growth, an exploratory biopsy is imperative.\\nMeanwhile, cytologic examination of microscopic preparations (smear tests) are done\\nin order to differentiate from preliminary cervical or anal carcinoma. Cytological\\nresults of smears from the cervix are divided with the classification of Papanicolaou.\\nHIV and Sexually Transmitted Diseases    485'),\n",

However, the sensitivity\\nand specificity of these tests are still not sufficient (Panther 2004, Jablonka 2011). A\\nreview of anal cytologic examinations has shown a prediction of biopsy results for\\nanal dysplasia with a sensitivity of 69-93% and a specificity of 32–59% (Chiao 2006).\\nEvery suspicious cytologic finding should be monitored with a contemporary col-\\nposcopy or proctoscopy (Duerr 2006). Specialized centers offer the “High Resolution\\nAnoscopy” as gold standard, which improves the test results of peri- and intra-anal\\ninspections with regard to necessary exploratory biopsies, especially after the\\n application of acetic acid (3 per cent mucosa, 5 per cent skin) and an additional\\nstaining with Lugol’s solution. Suspicious lesions have to be biopsied. Histologically,\\nexaminations of intralesional biopsies differ in Condylomata acuminata, intraepithe-\\nlial neoplasia divided in severity grades I-III (IN) and invasive cancer. The abbrevia-\\ntion of the anatomic location of the lesion is specified in front of the IN grade. The\\ndescription AIN III is in accordance with an anal carcinoma in situ. The determina-\\ntion of the HPV subtype allows for differentiation between high- and low-risk types\\nand is still not a routine diagnostic method, because of its subordinate role in therapy\\ndecisions (Ledger 2000). When high-risk HPV-types are detected, some experts\\n recommend to shorten the period between control examinations of the affected\\nregion. \\nJust like women, HIV+ men, mainly those suffering from condyloma anamnesis,\\nshould have a proctological follow-up at least once a year (Chiao 2006, Scott 2008,\\nWexler 2008, Jamieson 2006, Esser 2011). To avoid fatal tumor growth and mutilat-\\ning operations (rectum amputation, etc) it is recommended to do thorough genito-\\nanal inspections and regular proctological exams by means of high resolution\\nanoscopy with cytological smears and exploratory excision, which are timely and\\nspecific (Kreuter 2009, Pindea 2008). Rectal palpation and external inspection of the\\nanogenital regions are not sufficient as a preventive medical checkup for HIV+\\npatients. Should an anal carcinoma be palpable, it has, in general, already progressed\\nextensively. Until today, there are no good reports on how often intra-anal, HPV-\\nassociated lesions are isolated without involving the external genito-anal regions.\\nNowadays there are surveys trying to find out how often colposcopic and procto-\\nscopic exams should be offered in addition to the routine genito-anal palpations and\\ninspections, and exactly who should be examined. \\nTherapy\\nUntil now there is no satisfying therapy for Condylomata acuminata. Relapses still\\noccur frequently even after adequate treatment in immune competent HIV-negative\\npatients (40-60%). However, therapy delays (watch & wait) should be avoided and\\nall clinically striking findings should be removed at an early stage even at the risk\\nof operating multiple times. Therapy includes the most complete operative removal\\npossible with histological follow-up of the nature of the tumor and its invasive depth.\\nBesides surgical excision, electrosurgery, the condyloma may be removed by means\\nof laser surgery, infrared coagulation, caustica (trichloroacetic or podophyllotoxin)\\nor cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen (high healing effect initially – high relapse risk).\\nAll the destructive treatments have disadvantages. Since virus-harboring\\n keratinocytes can remain in the clinically normal surrounding tissue, relapses are as\\nfrequent as 50% in immunocompetent patients and in up to 70% in immunodefi-\\ncient patients within 4 months.

As demonstrated in several controlled studies imiquimod\\ntreatment is safe and effective and has the lowest relapse rate of all treatments \\n(6-13% in immunocompetent patients). Imiquimod is not approved for the treat-\\nment of anogenital warts in immunodeficient patients and intraepithelial neoplasias\\nbut results of successful treatments of genital warts (Cusini 2004), Bowenoid papu-\\nlosis and Bowen’s disease in HIV+ patients have been published (Kreuter 2008). In\\nour own experience imiquimod can be successfully used as the sole therapy for flat,\\nless hyperkeratotic condyloma. There are formulas for imiquimod-containing sup-\\npositories (off-label). However, the treatment period takes several weeks without sur-\\ngical intervention, often complicated by compliance-reducing side effects such as\\ninflammation, pruritus and burning. Condyloma may also be systemically treated\\nwith interferon (there are often problems with health insurance due to a low success\\nrate of 31% in the intial stages, although there are reports of a significantly lower\\nrelapse rate in comparison with other invasive therapies).

Dis Colon Rectum 2008;51:73-81.\\nShigellosis\\nShigella is a worldwide gram-negative bacteria related to the family of enteric bac-\\nteria which can be divided into different pathogenic serogroups (A-D) and serovars\\n(group A: S. dysenteriae, B: S. flexneri, C: S. boydii, D: S. sonnei), depending on certain\\nbiochemical features and specific antigens. All shigella groups release an endotoxin\\nwhich causes infection of the intestinal mucosa. S. dysenteriae type 1 also produces\\nan exotoxin which often leads to severe symptoms involving insufficiency of the\\ncardiovascular system and CNS disorders. \\nHumans are the only relevant hosts. Shigellosis is spread via fecal-oral transmission,\\nmost frequently through direct contact, i.e., by lack of proper hygiene and poor hand\\nwashing habits. Although shigella bacteria usually do not survive outside the human\\nbody, infection can be transmitted via contaminated water or food in warmer coun-\\ntries. As few as 100 perorally transmitted germs are enough to cause an infection.\\nShigella bacteria grow in the intestinal mucosa of humans and are shed in the feces.\\nThe incubation period is usually between 12-96 hours. Infections can be transmit-\\nted after a phase of acute illness and as long as the bacteria is excreted in stool, but\\nusually no more than four weeks. Prevention of the spread of this highly contagious\\nbacteria is complicated, as stool specimens can appear clinically normal.\\nWith regard to sexual practices, sexually transmitted shigellosis appear rather fre-\\nquently within certain risk groups such as MSM and cause regional outbreaks (RKI\\n2002+2005, Aragón 2007, Daskalakis 2007, Keay 2014).

In two outbreaks in Berlin in the years 2001 and\\n2004, the S. sonnei isolates in stool specimens showed similar isotopes and identical\\nresistance patterns. Resistance was observed to TMP/SMX, tetracyclines, amoxicillin,\\nampicillin/sulbactam and mezlocillin (RKI 2002, Marcus 2004, RKI 2005). A more\\nrecent analysis investigated 52 cases of S. sonnei in MSM suffering with diarrhea in\\nthree major HIV clinics in Berlin and Hamburg. Results showed high rates of\\nquinolone resistance especially high in HIV-infected MSM (for ciprofloxacin, 53%\\nversus 21% in negative MSM). No resistance was found against carbapenem and\\nnewer cephalosporins, such as ceftriaxone, ceftazidime or cefepime (Hoffmann\\n2013). However, resistance to the commonly administered antibiotics is increasing\\nworldwide (Niyogi 2007, Gaudreau 2010).\\nClinical course\\nMany infections with shigella may present as a mild, self-limited illness. However,\\nthe clinical course of shigellosis varies widely, from asymptomatic disease, watery\\ndiarrhea, dysentery (bloody and mucoid stools) up to life-threatening septic courses.\\nMostly, shigellosis begins with watery diarrhea and can develop into an inflamma-\\ntory colitis. Abdominal pain (colitis and tenesmus) is a typical sign. Frequent defe-\\ncation (up to 50 times a day) can cause dehydration and loss of proteins. Usually,\\nshigellosis resolves within 7 days. Fever, bloody, mucoid and ulcerous diarrhea are\\nsymptoms of severe cases. Focal ulcerations and necrosis appear most frequently in\\nthe distal colon that can develop into dilatation of the colon and colon perforation\\nwith following peritonitis and sepsis in extreme cases.\\nIn rare cases (1-3%) shigellosis manifests outside the intestines: cytotoxin (Shiga\\ntoxin) produced by S. dysenteria serovar 1 is almost identical to Shiga toxin 1 (vero-\\ntoxin 1) enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) that also causes a hemolytic uremic syn-\\ndrome (HUS). Other possible sequels are infectious arthritis and Reiter’s syndrome.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made by bacteriological investigation of freshly obtained stool or rectal\\nsmears. The stool sample is suspended in MacConkey agar to identify non-lactose\\nfermenters such as shigella species. More selective media cultures and slide aggluti-\\nnation are then used to identify group and serotypes. The samples should be obtained\\nbefore taking antibiotics and an antibiogram should be made. Results of resistance\\ntests may be adjusted if therapy with antibiotics has already commenced.\\nIdentification of the infection sources and transmission paths help to define the\\nserogroups and serovars involved.\\nTherapy\\nSince shigellosis is highly infectious, treatment with antibiotics is recommended.\\nWith antibiotics, the period of fecal shedding, diarrhea and illness is shortened\\n(Christopher 2012). Quinolones, TMP/SMX, azithromycin, tetracyclines, doxycy-\\ncline and ampicillin are suitable. Ampicillin is recommended for treatment of long-\\nterm carriers. In resource-limited areas, the drug of choice is ciprofloxacin (500 mg\\nBID) or TMP/SMX (160 mg/800 mg BID) for five to seven days, respectively. However,\\nin Western metropolitan areas and in cases of MSM infected with shigella, increas-\\ning resistance rates have to be considered (Niyogi 2007, Gaudreau 2010, Hoffmann\\n2013). In an analysis of 52 cases occurring in Hamburg and Berlin in 2010/2011,\\nhigh resistance rates were found for doxycycline, tetracycline, aminoglycosides, all\\nHIV and Sexually Transmitted Diseases    491'),\n",

As shigellosis is usually passed through direct contact\\nfrom human to human, the most effective prevention is frequent and careful hand\\nwashing to avoid fecal and oral smear infections. Hands should be washed with soap\\nor with an alcohol containing disinfectant. In countries with poor hygienic condi-\\ntions one should follow the recommendation, “Peel it, boil it, cook it or forget it”.\\nAs shigellosis is highly contagious and HIV+ patients possibly more vulnerable (Baer\\n1999), preventive measures against sexually transmitted shigellosis are more strict\\nthan with other STDs. Use of condoms for anal sex does not provide sufficient pro-\\ntection. Sexual contact should be avoided from the first days of diarrhea onwards\\nuntil shigella bacteria are no longer detectable in the stool.\\nEarly diagnosis and treatment prevents further infection. During the course of illness,\\nmeasures should be taken to disinfect all objects and surfaces which may have come\\ninto contact with the patient’s infectious excretions. Clothes, bed sheets and towels\\nshould be washed at least 60°C or be soaked in disinfectant for 12 hours before\\nwashing at normal washing temperature. Toilet seats and lids, as well as bed frames,\\nsinks and bath tubs should be disinfected daily in health care facilities.\\nOwners of bars and darkrooms as well as organizers of sex parties should install soap\\ndispensers in the washrooms. Sharing of used and inadequately disinfected dildos\\nor tubes with lubrication gels should be avoided. Operators of saunas should chlo-\\nrinate their whirlpools.\\nOther preventive measures for schools and other public facilities and food produc-\\ntion companies, should follow preventive guidelines given by the authorities for\\ndisease control and prevention. People who are, or are suspected to be infected with\\nshigellosis, are not allowed to work in facilities where food is produced or processed.\\nThis also applies to long-term carriers (asymptomatic shedders) of the infection.\\nAdmission to public facilities is possible after clinical recovery and three negative\\nstool test results (stool samples after 1–2 days, respectively). The first sample should\\nbe taken after at least 24 hours after appearance of formed stool or 24 hours after\\nending a therapy with antibiotics. People in close contact with an infected patient\\nshould be tested after the incubation period and test negative. An exception may be\\nmade if typical symptoms do not show and otherwise hygienic measures are followed.\\nClose personal contacts and a lack of hygiene, especially in community facilities\\nencourage a spread of shigellosis. If a shigellosis outbreak is suspected, a quick iden-\\ntification of the source of the infection and transmission factors (i.e, food) can avoid\\nfurther spread of the infection. In any case, the public health department should be\\ninformed as soon as possible.\\n492 Other Infections than HIV-1'),\n",

Vaccinations and HIV\\nTHOMAS WEITZEL\\nHIV+ patients have an increased morbidity and mortality due to various infectious\\ndiseases that are vaccine preventable. On the other hand, vaccinations might cause\\na higher rate of adverse effects in HIV+ patients, who are also prone to a higher rate\\nof failure in achieving a protective immune response. Indication and timing of vac-\\ncination should therefore reflect each patient’s individual situation – the better the\\nimmune status, the higher the chances for an appropriate immune response. Thus,\\nindications should be checked as soon as a patient is diagnosed with HIV (see chapter\\nChecklist: The new HIV patient). In severely immunocompromised patients, vaccina-\\ntions are usually not successful and might even be contraindicated. In such cases,\\nthe immunization status of close contacts should be checked and, if necessary, com-\\npleted information about exposure and exposure prophylaxis should be provided.\\nIn certain situations, passive immunoprophylaxis might be indicated. When ART\\nleads to a sustained rise in CD4 counts, vaccinations should be reconsidered and/or\\nrepeated. Recent studies demonstrate that many HIV+ patients do not receive the\\nvaccinations that are internationally recommended (Molton 2010, Mohseni-Sadar\\n2010). \\nBenefits of vaccination\\nDepending on their immune status, a poorer response to previous vaccines and an\\naccelerated decline of protective immunity over time must be expected. Until\\nrecently, the rule of thumb was that: \\n\\x81 the response to vaccination is reduced if CD4 T cells are <300/µl,\\n\\x81 no vaccination response is expected if CD4 T cells are <100/µl (Rosseau 1999).\\nNewer data question this concept since in patients with sufficient viral suppression\\nsome vaccines (e.g., influenza) exhibited an immune response that was independ-\\nent from CD4 T cell counts (Hatakeyama 2011). Still, re-vaccinations should be recon-\\nsidered if CD4 T cells rise to >200/µl. To evaluate possible benefits of vaccinations,\\nthe anamnesis should include the following factors:\\nCurrent status of protection Current risk of infection\\n• Prior infections • Sexual risks\\n• Prior vaccinations (problem: reduced • Occupational risks\\neffectivity in severely immunocompromised • Contacts with infected individuals\\npatients, consider antibody control) • Contacts with children\\n• Traveling\\nRisks of vaccination\\nSome vaccinations might cause transient viral load increases. This effect reflects the\\nstimulation of cellular immunity and does not occur in non-responders to the\\nvaccine. The peak of this increased viral replication appears 1 to 3 weeks after the\\nvaccination. Therefore, routine measurement of viral load should be avoided within\\nfour weeks after vaccinations. Numerous studies demonstrate that these transient\\nelevations of the viral load are clinically and immunologically irrelevant. Still, geno-\\ntyping before and after an influenza vaccine demonstrated in 2 out of 34 patients\\nnew mutations of the RT- or protease-gene (Kolber 2002). Furthermore, the elevated\\nviral replication can (theoretically) increase the risk of materno-fetal transmission. \\n494'),\n",

However, if contacts shed certain live vaccines, they might infect HIV+\\npatients. Therefore:\\n\\x81 Avoid oral polio and smallpox vaccinations of close contact persons\\n\\x81 Avoid stool contact (e.g. changing dipers) for 4 weeks after rotavirus vaccination\\n(Rubin 2013)\\n\\x81 Avoid contact with skin lesions after varicella or zoster vaccinations; consider pro-\\nphylactic use of acyclovir (German recommendation: STIKO 2005).\\nOther live vaccines of contacts bear no risk. \\nVaccinations in HIV+ children\\nEuropean Guidelines have recently been published (Menson 2012). With few excep-\\ntions, HIV+ children should be vaccinated according to national children vaccina-\\ntion schedules. BCG vaccination is generally not recommended. Children with severe\\nimmunodeficiency (relative CD4 T cell count <15%) should not receive live vaccines\\nsuch as MMR and varicella vaccine. Above this level, children can be vaccinated with\\nMMR and according to the latest US recommendations, also with varicella vaccine\\n(Mofenson 2009). Due to lack of data, quadruple MMRV vaccine should be avoided.\\nIf one of those live vaccines cannot be applied, all family contacts (especially sib-\\nlings) should be vaccinated. Antibody response might be controlled after vaccina-\\ntion, especially for measles and rubella (Menson 2012). HIV-infected children should\\nreceive a routine series of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), starting in the\\nsecond month of life. If and when to add polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) is contro-\\nversial (Menson 2012). Rotavirus live vaccine is now recommended for children in\\nmany countries. There are few data on the efficacy and safety. While American experts\\nfavor the use of this vaccine in HIV+ children (Rubin 2013), European guidelines are\\nmore restrictive (Menson 2012). \\nPost-exposure prophylaxis\\nWith some infections, the risk of infection and/or disease severity can be reduced\\nby post-exposure prophylaxis, including active and passive immunizations as well\\nas chemoprophylaxis (Table 2). Usually, the time between exposure and the start of\\nprophylactic measures is crucial and should be minimized. \\nPractical approach to vaccinations\\nInformed consent: The obligation to inform vaccines follows national recommen-\\ndations (in Germany: see STIKO 2004). Patients should be informed about the risks\\nand benefits of vaccines, with particular attention to HIV-related vaccination\\n problems. In some countries, written informed consent is required. For vaccine\\n information statements in different languages see www.immunize.org.\\nTiming: Vaccinations should be postponed when an acute infection is present;\\nhowever, a mild afebrile infection is not relevant.

After treatment with immunoglobulins, live vaccines should not be\\nadministered within the following three months (exception: yellow fever vaccine).\\nWhen exact viral load measurements are crucial (e.g. decisions about ART),\\n vaccinations should be postponed as they might influence viral replication.\\nBooster vs. complete series:As a rule of thumb, a complete series is necessary when\\nno prior dose of the respective vaccination is reported or documented. That means\\nthat a past incomplete primary series can be completed independent of a time delay\\nbetween the necessary shots (every shot counts!). This strategy does not take into\\naccount that vaccinations might be repeated if prior doses were given at a time when\\nthe patient was significantly immunosuppressed. \\nRoute of application: Vaccination routes should follow the recommendations pro-\\nvided by the manufacturer. High immunogenicity and few complications make intra-\\nmuscular injections the preferable application route (deltoid muscle, in infants also\\nanterolateral thigh; gluteal applications are obsolete!). Many vaccines can also be\\nadministered subcutaneously (see product information). In hemophiliacs, subcuta-\\nneous vaccination followed by thorough compression (>2 minutes) usually allows\\nvaccination without coadministration of clotting factors. Only a few vaccines have\\nto be administered subcutaneously, including meningococcal polysaccharide, yellow\\nfever, and some varicella vaccines. Intradermal rabies vaccination schedules, which\\nare licensed in some countries, should not be administered to HIV+ patients due to\\nreduced immunogenicity (Tantawichien 2001).\\nCombination vaccines: In general, it is recommendable to combine vaccines to\\nminimize patient discomfort (and sometimes costs). \\nDocumentation: Vaccinations should be documented in the patient’s medical\\nrecords as well as in a vaccination card kept by the patient. For the latter, a WHO\\nrecommended form can be ordered either through WHO or national providers.\\nDocumentation includes the brand, manufacturer, and lot number of the vaccine.\\nDetails of selected vaccines in HIV+ patients\\nTetanus/Diphtheria/Pertussis: Following a primary series during childhood, life-\\nlong protection against tetanus/diphtheria should be maintained by boosters every\\n10 years. According to a Danish study (Kurtzhals 1992), protection against diph-\\ntheria is often insufficient. Depending on their CD4 T cells, patients have a reduced\\nresponse to boosters and an accelerated antibody waning (Moss 2003). Combination\\nvaccines including polio and/or pertussis are available and suitable. Recently, most\\ncountries recommend a single booster of acellular pertussis vaccine for adults. Since\\nadult pertussis vaccine is only available as a combination vaccine (e.g., Tdap), its use\\nshould be considered whenever tetanus and/or diphtheria vaccination is indicated.\\nPneumococcal: Even under ART, there is an increased risk of invasive pneumococ-\\ncal infections (Jordano 2004) which can be reduced with the 23-valent pneumo-\\ncoccal vaccine PPSV23 (Grau 2005, Rodriguez-Barradas 2008). The vaccine response\\nin patients under ART with CD4 cell counts >200/µl is similar to healthy individu-\\nals (Falco 2006). However, a cohort study demonstrated that patients with VL\\n>100,000/ml did not benefit independent of their immune status (Teshale 2008).\\nRecent data indicate that pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) might induce a\\nstronger and longer lasting protective effect (Nunes 2012). A placebo-controlled trial\\nin Malawi showed an efficacy of 74% using PCV7 (French 2010). Therefore, most\\nguidelines now recommend the combination of PCV and PPV.

If CD4 T cell counts are lower, this vaccine might be considered, if\\npatients are under ART and have low VL, or be postponed until the immune status\\nrecovers. Patients already vaccinated with PPV23 receive additional PPV13 after a\\ntime span of at least 12 months. PPV23 is repeated once after 5 years, then again\\nwhen the patient is 65 years old (CDC 2012, Panel on OI 2015). This strategy pro-\\nvides  additional protection and is cost effective (Cho 2013). \\nInfluenza: HIV+ patients have an increased risk of severe manifestations of influenza\\ninfection and a higher influenza-associated mortality (Lin 2001). Influenza vaccine\\nis effective (Anema 2008). Since influenza remains a frequent cause of febrile respi-\\nratory infections even in vaccinated patients (Klein 2007), private and healthcare\\ncontacts should also annually be vaccinated. All patients older than six months\\nshould receive inactivated influenza vaccine at the beginning of each influenza\\nseason independent of their CD4 status (Geretti 2008). In children under 10 years\\nof age, the first vaccination should include two doses at a 4-week interval. Intranasal\\nlive vaccines are not recommended by most experts.\\nHepatitis B: According to international standards, every hepatitis B susceptible\\npatient should be vaccinated; a recommendation that is not consistently followed\\nin daily routine (Bailey 2008). The combination vaccine with hepatitis A should be\\npreferred as it is more immunogenic (van der Wielen 2006). In HIV+ patients, the\\nreduced immune response to hepatitis B vaccination is well known (van den Berg\\n2009). Depending on CD4 T cell counts and other factors such as viral load, gender,\\nand age (Fisman 2002, Overton 2005), only 20-70% of patients will develop protec-\\ntive immunity (Laurence 2005). Success rates were higher in some studies using mul-\\ntiple and/or higher doses or more effective adjuvants (Whitaker 2012). Interestingly,\\npatients taking ART have a better vaccine responses even if they have high CD4\\ncounts (Landrum 2009). Although the optimal vaccination strategy is still under\\ndebate, there is a consensus to:\\n\\x81 Vaccinate early after diagnosis\\n\\x81 Control immune response 4 weeks after the last shot\\n\\x81 Revaccinate if the immune response is lacking or suboptimal (Germany: <100, USA:\\n<10 IU/ml) and/or if there is substantial immunoreconstitution\\nIt is recommended to start with a normal vaccination schedule (3 doses of 10–20 µg).\\nIf the initial schedule fails to generate sufficient response, revaccination using 3 or\\n4 dose schedules and normal or double dose vaccines (40 µg) is advisable (Panel OI\\n2015). The use of hepatitis A/B combination vaccine (Twinrix\\n®) in double dose was\\nalso successful (Cardell 2008). British and US guidelines recommend annual controls\\nof anti-HBs levels (Geretti 2008, Panel on OI 2015). The management of “isolated”\\nanti-HBc is less clear (this constellation might be due to a false positive results, a loss\\nof anti-HBs after infection or an occult HBV infection). Most experts recommend to\\nconsider these patients HBV susceptible and to vaccinate them as described above.\\nHepatitis A: is common (Fonquernie 2001). The vaccine is indicated in patients with\\nchronic liver disease or increased risk of exposure, e.g. MSM, hemophilia or travel-\\ning to high-prevalence areas. Routine pre-vaccination serology (HAV IgG) is not gen-\\nerally recommended, but can be considered in patients with possible prior exposure.\\nResponse is reduced especially if CD4 T cells counts are below 200/µl. Post-vaccina-\\ntion controls are recommendable. Non-responders should be revaccinated after CD4\\ncounts rise using a normal 2-dose or a 3-dose schedule (Launay 2008). A combina-\\ntion vaccine with HBV is available and reduces costs (see above). \\nMeasles: As measles causes severe disease in HIV+ patients (Kaplan 1992), patients\\nwithout proven past infection or vaccination should be vaccinated (two doses sep-\\nVaccinations and HIV    497'),\n",

The status of protection should be checked prior to trips\\nto endemic areas (see chapter Traveling with HIV). It is possible to vaccinate patients\\nwith CD4 T cells >200/µl (different age-specific values in children) or >15%, who are\\nmildly symptomatic or asymptomatic. Commonly, the MMR combination vaccine\\nis used. For susceptible patients, immunoglobulin administration is indicated as post-\\nexposure prophylaxis (in certain high-risk situations also pre-exposure prophylaxis).\\nYellow fever (YF): Available data (<600 patients) indicate that asymptomatic patients\\nwith CD4 T cell counts above 200/µl can receive YF vaccine securely (Staples 2010).\\nHowever, patients have reduced rates of seroconversion, depending on CD4 T cell\\nstatus and viral load (Thomas 2012, Sidibe 2013, Barte 2014). One asymptomatic\\npatient with a low CD4 count developed fatal encephalitis (Kengsakul 2002). Older\\nindividuals have a higher risk for severe adverse events (Khromava 2005). British\\nguidelines disapprove YF vaccination in HIV+ patients >60 years of age (Geretti 2008).\\nDue to reduced response rates, titre controls are often recommended. Another\\napproach is the documentation of seroconversion in a paired serum sample (before\\nand 2-3 weeks after vaccination. Patients who cannot receive the vaccine should not\\ntravel to YF endemic areas. Patients requiring a vaccination certificate only due to\\nentry regulations (without a real risk of exposure) should receive a medical waiver\\nstating that vaccination is not possible due to medical reasons. The new recom-\\nmendations stating that most travelers do not need revaccinations every 10 years\\n(WHO 2015, Staples 2015) does not apply to immunocompromised individuals.\\nHuman papilloma virus (HPV): In many countries, HPV vaccination of juvenile\\ngirls is part of the routine vaccination schedule. In 2011, the US recommendations\\nalso included boys and young adults, especially MSM. The benefits in HIV+ patients\\nare subject of ongoing studies. American guidelines favor catch-up vaccinations of\\nall women, MSM, and HIV+ men up to the age of 26 years. Up to now, only the \\n4- and the newly introduced 9-valent vaccines are licensed for use in men; the \\n2-valent vaccine might have the advantage to be more immunogenic because of its\\nadjuvants (Menson 2012, Toft 2013).\\nVaricella: Similar to measles, chickenpox is potentially life-threatening for HIV+\\npatients (Perronne 1990). Patients without a history of VZV infections (chickenpox\\nor herpes zoster) or vaccination should be screened for antibodies. If susceptible and\\nwith CD4 T counts >200/µl, patients should be vaccinated (Geretti 2008, Kaplan\\n2009, Rubin 2014); although German recommendations are more restrictive (CD4\\n>25%, STIKO 2005). Vaccine complications should be treated with acyclovir. Zoster-\\nlike reactivations of the vaccine strain are possible but very rare. The zoster vaccine\\ncontains a higher dose of the Oka vaccine strain and was therefore initially\\n contraindicated (Kimberlin 2007). Newer guides restrict this contraindication to\\nthose with CD4 T counts <200/µl (CDC 2011), but also do not generally recommend\\nthe vaccine to those with higher CD4 counts. It might be considered on an indi-\\nvidual basis for patients >60 years with a good immune status. \\nMeningococcal infection: The risk of invasive meningococcal infections seem to\\nbe increased (Miller 2014). However, since the risk in general is very low, HIV infec-\\ntion alone is not considered an indication to vaccinate. In Germany, the 4-valent\\nconjugate vaccine for people is recommended with immunodeficiency (without HIV\\nbeing mentioned). Since clusters of severe meningococcal infections have recently\\nbeen observed in MSM in several major cities, some experts suggested to vaccinate\\npatients with a higher risk situation, e.g. attending mass events such as gay parades\\n(Simon 2013). HIV+ patients, who have an indication for meningococcal vaccina-\\ntion, are vaccinated twice at an interval of 2-3 months (Cohn 2013).\\nThe following tables summarize current recommendations.\\n498 Other Infections than HIV-1'),\n",

Traveling with HIV\\nTHOMAS WEITZEL\\nAbout 10-15% of European and North American HIV+ patients travel abroad at least\\nonce yearly. Such travel activities frequently include visits to tropical and develop-\\ning countries (Salit 2005). Many of those have a migration background (Sherrard\\n2009) and belong to the group of travellers visiting friends and relatives (VFRs), who\\nhave a high risk of travel-associated infections (recent reviews and guidelines: Igreja\\n2008, Franco-Paredes 2009, Nelson 2011, Smith 2012).\\nTravel preparations\\nEspecially if CD4 T counts are below 200/µl, there is an increased risk of travel-asso-\\nciated infections and furthermore, the effectiveness of vaccinations is reduced. Trips\\nshould be planned at least 6 to 8 weeks in advance. In case of special health risks\\n(e.g., tropical destinations), a travel medicine specialist should be consulted. For a\\ngeneral overview of travel recommendations, see the links below. Long-term travel-\\ners should clarify the treatment possibilities of HIV-related problems at their\\n destination. A first-aid kit should contain local antihistamines, disinfectants, sun\\nprotection, analgesics, antipyretics, antiemetics, antidiarrheals and an antibiotic for\\nthe empirical treatment of traveler’s diarrhea (see below).\\nAntiretroviral therapy (ART)\\nART naïve patients with CD4 T cell counts <200/µl should postpone travel activities\\nuntil their immune status has improved. An ongoing ART should be proven to be\\neffective and well-tolerated. Depending on destination, planned activities and\\n compliance problems (Salit 2005), a therapy interruption might be considered. If\\nART is continued during traveling, the following points are important:\\n\\x81 Pack sufficient amount of ARVs, preferably in the hand luggage \\n\\x81 Check availability of ART at destination beforehand. Consider carrying prescrip-\\ntions and a medical letter in English. \\n\\x81 Pack ARVs in neutral packages if necessary (see entry regulations below) \\n\\x81 Check storage requirements for prescription drugs (e.g. refrigeration) in advance.\\n\\x81 Discuss unplanned therapy interruptions during travel in advance.\\nGeneral precautions\\nHIV+ travelers should follow the five Golden Rules of travel medicine (cited by Dr.\\nDavid Smith, Toronto):\\n\\x81 Don’t get hit (accidents, crime) \\n\\x81 Don’t get bit (mosquitos and other animals)\\n\\x81 Don’t get lit (alcohol and other drugs)\\n\\x81 Don’t do “it” (casual sex, tattoos, piercings, etc.)\\n\\x81 Don’t eat shit (food and water hygiene)\\nDue to the particular risk of gastrointestinal infections (Hayes 2003), they should\\navoid the following foodstuff and drinks:\\n\\x81 Raw fruit or vegetables that are not peeled\\n\\x81 Raw or undercooked meat or fish dishes\\n\\x81 Tap water, ice cubes from tap water, unpasteurized milk or milk products\\n\\x81 Food distributed under insecure hygienic circumstances (e.g., street vendors)\\n506'),\n",

In areas\\nup to 2000 meters above sea level, a boiling time of one minute kills all potential\\npathogens; at higher altitudes, the boiling time should be prolonged to three minutes.\\nChemical treatment and filtration methods are less reliable. \\nThe prevention of vector-borne infections includes:\\n\\x81 Wearing long-sleeves and bright clothes if outdoors.\\n\\x81 Using repellents (e.g., DEET-based with concentrations of 30–50%) on uncovered\\nskin areas (apply sun protection before repellent). \\n\\x81 Avoiding outdoor stays at dawn or night.\\n\\x81 Sleeping in mosquito-safe areas (mosquito nets or air conditioned rooms).\\n\\x81 Treating clothes and mosquito nets with permethrin for additional safety.\\nSince condoms and lubricants abroad are not always available, a sufficient amount\\nof these products should be brought along to guarantee safe sex during the holiday. \\nBecause of possible Strongyloides stercoralis infection (see below), direct skin contact\\nto fecally contaminated soil should be avoided. It is wise to wear closed shoes and\\nplace a towel underneath when lying on the ground. \\nPrecautions against zoonotic infections such as salmonella or cryptosporidiosis\\ninclude proper hand washing following animal contact.\\nVaccinations\\nA travel medicine consultation is an opportunity to check and complete routinely\\nrecommended immunizations such as tetanus/diphtheria/pertussis, pneumococcal\\ndisease, influenza, and hepatitis B vaccinations (see chapter on HIV and Vaccinat -\\nions). It has to be kept in mind that the southern hemisphere influenza season is\\nfrom April to September, while in the tropics influenza can occur all year long. \\nAdditional immunizations have to be considered according to destination, duration,\\nand travel style. In general, most travel vaccines are more generously indicated for\\nHIV+ travelers than in healthy travelers. This affects for example the parenteral\\ntyphoid fever vaccine (since S. typhi infections in HIV+ patients are more severe and\\nrelapse more often) or the pre-exposure rabies vaccination (Chadwick 2007).\\nAccording to US American recommendations, immunocompromized travelers\\nrequiring hepatitis A vaccination shortly before departure (<14 days) should receive\\npassive immunization (ACIP 2007). Other immunization questions usually require\\nthe consultation of a specialized travel medicine institution.\\nMalaria prophylaxis\\nInteractions between antiretroviral drugs and drugs for malaria prophylaxis such as\\nchloroquine, mefloquine, doxycycline, and Malarone\\n® (atovaquone/ proguanil) are\\nnot completely evaluated (Khoo 2005). A recent review (Skinner-Adams 2008) as well\\nas internet-based databases (e.g., www.hiv-druginteractions.org) provide compre-\\nhensive information. Here a short summary:\\n\\x81 Chloroquine: Nowadays rarely used for prophylaxis. Potential interaction with\\nritonavir, dose adjustment, however, is not necessary. \\n\\x81 Mefloquine: Potential interactions with PIs, which might increase mefloquine\\nlevels and risk of side effects, although this was not confirmed in a study with\\nritonavir. Relevant interactions with other classes of ARVs are unlikely (although\\nnot studied). A recent study raised concerns discovering an increased viremia and\\nmother-to-child transmission rates in mothers receiving mefloquine intermittent\\ntreatment together with different ART regimens (González 2014).  \\nTraveling with HIV    507'),\n",

A reduction of the proguanil level\\ninduced by ritonavir, lopinavir or efavirenz is possible, although the clinical rele-\\nvance is unclear. It is important to urge a proper intake of Malarone\\n® (with a high-\\nfat meal) and to be aware of the possibility of prophylaxis failures. \\n\\x81 Doxycycline: is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. Relevant inter-\\nactions are unlikely, which was confirmed by a current study (Abgrall 2013).\\nAvailable data and clinical experience indicate that chloroquine, Malarone ®, and\\ndoxycycline can be safely and effectively used in patients taking antiretroviral\\ntherapy. Mefloquine with its potential of interactions (especially when taken with\\nPIs) and its contraindication in patients with neurological comorbidity, might be\\nconsidered as a second line option. The antiplasmodial effects of cotrimoxazole and\\nPIs are not sufficient for malaria prophylaxis.\\nThe German speaking countries (Germany, Switzerland, and Austria) recommend\\nstandby emergency treatment (SBET) for certain travelers to areas with low malaria\\nrisk (www.dtg.org). Drugs used for this indication depend on the resistance situation\\nin the visited region and include chloroquine, Malarone\\n®, and artemether/lume-\\nfantrine (Riamet®). The latter belongs to the ACT drugs (artemisinin combination\\ntherapy), which are considered first line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in\\nmany countries. Data on interactions of these drug combinations with ART are hardly\\nknown and conflicting (van Geertruyden 2014). Co-administration with PIs might\\nlead to increased toxicity, but also showed a synergistic antimalarial effect, which\\nmight be a benefit for inhabitants of hyperendemic regions (Achan 2012). Studies\\ninvolving efavirenz showed a significant reduction of lumefantrine leading to a rec-\\nommended dose modification of Riamet\\n® (Maganda 2015) and potential hepatotoxic\\neffects if coadministrated with amodiaquine/artesunate, another ACT (German\\n2007). Therefore, if SBET is used in patients taking PIs or efavirenz, Malarone\\n® might\\nbe preferred. \\nEntry regulations and travel insurance\\nEntry restrictions for HIV+ travelers violate internationally recognized basic human\\nrights; furthermore, they are counterproductive as a measure of health policy and\\nexplicitly rejected by WHO and UNAIDS. In January 2010, the much criticized restric-\\ntions of HIV+ travelers to the US were finally lifted. However, many countries con-\\ntinue to refuse entry. \\nTo avoid problems, information on entry regulations should be obtained before-\\nhand. The brochure “Schnellfinder” (www.aidshilfe.de), which is available in various\\nlanguages, provides a comprehensive overview on entry policies. In cooperation with\\nthe European AIDS Treatment Group, a regularly updated English version is avail-\\nable online at www.hivtravel.org. Travel insurance usually excludes existing illnesses\\nand often refuses HIV+ individuals explicitly. Still, few travel insurances do not follow\\nthat policy (e.g., World First).\\nSpecial risks\\nEnteric infections\\nReduced immunological defense and diminished gastric acid production increase the\\nrisk for gastrointestinal infections in HIV+ patients; in addition, MSM have a higher\\nexposure risk to intestinal pathogens including parasites (Abdolrasouli 2009).\\nFurthermore, bacterial enteropathogens such as Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylo -\\nbacter bear a high risk of bacteremia and relapse (Angulo 1995).

In regions with high rates of quinolone resistance such as\\nSoutheast Asia, azithromycin should be used.\\nInstead of prophylaxis, empirical self-treatment of acute episodes of traveler’s\\n diarrhea is usually preferred using ciprofloxacin (500 mg bid) or azithromycin \\n(400 mg qd) for 3–5 days.\\nMalaria\\nThe interactions between HIV and malaria are alarming, especially in endemic areas\\n(Flateau 2011). In HIV+ patients, malaria episodes are more frequent and more severe\\n(Laufer 2006, Cohen 2005). HIV infection and low CD4 T-cell counts are risk factors\\nfor malaria treatment failure (Shah 2006). Also, malaria leads to a long-term increase\\nin HIV replication through proinflammatory cytokines (Kublin 2005) and might be\\nassociated with decreasing CD4 T cell counts (Mermin 2006). On the other hand,\\nHIV-associated cotrimoxazole prophylaxis and ARVs might reduce the morbidity of\\nmalaria in some regions (van Geertruyden 2014).\\nUp to now, recommendations for malaria therapy are not influenced by a con-\\ncomitant HIV infection with the exception of the proposed prolongation of therapy\\nduration with atovaquone/progualnil if co-administered with efavirenz (Maganda\\n2015). Still, it has to be kept in mind that drug interactions of antimalarial and HIV\\ndrugs are insufficiently established. The treatment of complicated malaria is espe-\\ncially problematic since quinine, quinidine or artemisinin derivatives are metabo-\\nlized by CYP3A4. The co-administration of these drugs with CYP3A4 inhibitors in\\npatients with severe malaria requires intensive monitoring, drug level monitoring\\n(if possible) or an interruption of ART.\\nMeasles\\nIn 2002, more than 200 million annual cases of measles with about 600,000 deaths\\nwere reported by WHO. In HIV+ patients, measles have a higher morbidity and\\n mortality. The virus is shed for prolonged periods of time (Moss 2002) which is\\n especially problematic in Africa (Moss 2006). American studies show a mortality rate\\nof 40%, mostly due to giant-cell pneumonitis (Kaplan 1996). Non-immune HIV+\\npatients should receive active or passive immunization before traveling to areas with\\na high prevalence of measles (see chapter on HIV and Vaccinations).\\nLeishmaniasis\\nVisceral leishmaniasis (kala azar) is a life-threatening opportunistic infection with\\nlimited therapeutic options (see chapter on AIDS). In German travelers, most infec-\\ntions are acquired in Mediterranean countries. The infection is more frequent in\\nHIV+ long-term travelers (Harms 2003, Weitzel 2005). Due to the infection’s poten-\\ntially extended latency period, symptoms can occur long after exposure in endemic\\nareas. Diagnosis is challenging, requiring cooperation with a specialized center.\\nSeverely immunocompromised HIV+ patients must be informed of the risk of\\n leishmaniasis even when traveling to Mediterranean countries. Preventive measures\\nagainst mosquito bites should be followed (see above); because of the vector’s small\\nsize, the use of impregnated mosquito nets of small mesh size is advisable. Cutaneous\\nleishmaniasis does not seem to occur more frequently.  \\nTraveling with HIV    509'),\n",

In most tropical and subtropical regions, the risk of\\ntuberculosis is higher than in Europe. Before and after long-term travel to such areas,\\nit is advisable to determine the TB reactivity by interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA)\\nof PPD skin test (Rieder 2001). Patients with a positive reaction or with a known\\nhigh-risk exposure and no further signs of active tuberculosis should receive a course\\nof treatment for latent tuberculosis (see chapter on Tuberculosis). HIV+ travelers\\nshould avoid risk areas such as hospitals, prisons or homeless shelters or wear\\n adequate facemasks. \\nEndemic mycoses\\nEndemic mycoses outside endemic areas are rare. Nevertheless, they are able to cause\\nlife-threatening opportunistic infections in HIV+ patients even years after a stay in\\nan endemic area. Most agents of endemic mycoses are thought to enter the\\n pulmonary tract after inhalation of infective spores. In areas endemic for Penicillium\\nmarneffei (South East Asia, Southern China) and Coccidioides immitis(south-west parts\\nof the USA, parts of Central and South America), increased exposure to dust or soil\\nshould be avoided (e.g. construction sites, agriculture, garden work, excavations).\\nHistoplasma capsulatum is prevalent worldwide in soil contaminated with bird and\\nbat droppings. Exposure might happen during eco- or adventure-tourism and should\\nbe avoided. In certain cases, e.g., severely immunocompromised patients with a\\n foreseeable contact with agents of endemic mycoses, primary prophylaxis can be\\nconsidered. Depending on the expected pathogen, either fluconazole or itracona-\\nzole should be prescribed. Another fungus that can cause severe infections is\\nSporothrix schenkii. This pathogen, which occurs worldwide, enters the body through\\ncutaneous lesions. Wearing gloves while working with plants, hay, or peat moss can\\nreduce the sporotrichosis risk.\\nSexually transmitted diseases\\nTraveling is associated with more frequent sexual encounters and less frequent use\\nof condoms (Matteelli 2001). The risk of STDs is substantially increased (Richens\\n2006). Patients should be aware of this. \\nOther parasites\\nThe following parasitic pathogens are relevant to HIV+ travelers:\\n\\x81 Strongyloides stercoralis is prevalent in most tropical and subtropical areas. The par-\\nasite is transmitted by cutaneous larval invasion after skin contact with contami-\\nnated soil. In HIV+ patients, there is the risk of a “hyperinfection syndrome” with\\na high fatality rate (Gompels 1991). Corticosteroids seems to be an important risk\\nfactor, as they may increase larval maturation triggering a cycle of massive autoin-\\nfection.\\n\\x81 Trypanosoma cruzi is endemic in large parts of Latin America. The protozoon that\\ncauses Chagas disease is transmitted by triatomine bugs but oral transmissions via\\ncontaminated fruit or sugarcane juice have also been reported. Chagas disease can\\npersist asymptomatically for many years and reactivate in severely immunocom-\\npromised patients. In these cases, lesions radiologically resembling cerebral toxo-\\nplasmosis are found in the central nervous system (Rocha 1994).\\n\\x81 Babesia sp, a worldwide cause of zoonotic infections, is transmitted by ticks. Severe\\ninfections, clinically mimicking malaria or manifesting as fever of unknown origin,\\nmainly occur in patients after splenectomy, but have also been reported in severely\\nimmunocompromised patients (Falagas 1996).\\n510 Other Infections than HIV-1'),\n",

In HIV+\\npatients, schistosomiasis treatment is less effective (Kallestrup 2006). The chronic\\nstimulation of the immune system has a negative influence on HIV infection (Secor\\n2006).

Because most tropical diseases are quite rare in temperate countries, diag-\\nnosis is often delayed. An analysis of imported visceral leishmaniasis in Germany\\nrevealed a median time span of 85 days until the diagnosis was established (Weitzel\\n2005). Furthermore, tropical diseases often manifest atypically (Karp 1999). In any\\nevent, differential diagnoses of diseases are very broad.

HIV-2 Infection\\nDIRK BERZOW\\nHIV-2 infection is less prevalent than HIV-1. An estimated 1 to 2 million people\\nworldwide are infected with HIV-2, most of them living in West Africa. As a conse-\\nquence, data on clinical monitoring and treatment is limited. \\nIntroduction\\nIn 1986, Luc Montagnier and colleagues reported the isolation of a novel retrovirus,\\nthe human immune deficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2, previously LAV-2), from AIDS\\npatients originating from West Africa (Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde Islands).\\nHybridization experiments indicated substantial differences between the genomes\\nof HIV-1 and HIV-2. Serological cross-reactivity was restricted to the major core\\nprotein, as the envelope glycoproteins of HIV-2 are not immunoprecipitated by HIV-1-\\npositive sera (Clavel 1986). \\nHIV-2 bears all the hallmarks of a lentivirus but is more closely related to simian\\nimmunodeficiency viruses (SIV) than HIV-1, despite a similar biology (Clavel 1986,\\nKanki 1986). Whereas HIV-1 in humans resulted from at least four cross-species trans-\\nmissions of SIVs from chimpanzees and gorillas in West Central Africa, HIV-2 resulted\\nfrom at least nine independent transmissions of SIVs infecting sooty mangabeys in\\nWest Africa only There are at least nine different HIV-2 subtypes. The most preva-\\nlent HIV-2 subtype is A (Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde Islands, Ghana,\\nIvory Coast), followed by B (Ghana, Ivory Coast). Others subtypes (C-I) are rarely\\nseen and are seemingly dead-end transmissions (Peeters 2014). \\nA reduced rate of clinical progression indicates that HIV-2 has a reduced virulence\\ncompared to HIV-1 (Marlink 1994). However, there are several diagnostic, clinical\\nand therapeutic challenges with HIV-2 infection to be discussed in this chapter.\\nEpidemiology\\nHIV-2 infection is endemic in West Africa. An estimated 1 to 2 million people in this\\nregion are infected with HIV-2. The proportion of HIV-2 among new HIV infections\\nworldwide is estimated to be 0.3–1%. However, in recent years HIV-2 prevalence has\\ndeclined markedly. The lower transmission rates of HIV-2 are probably due to its\\nlower viremia in infected individuals. For example, in a rural area like Guinea-Bissau,\\na region with one of the highest numbers of HIV-2 infections worldwide, prevalence\\ndeclined from 8.3% in 1990 to 4.7% in 2000. During the same period HIV-1 preva-\\nlence increased from 0.5% to 3.6% (van Tienen 2010). In Gambia, prevalence\\ndeclined from 7.0% in 1988–1991 to 4.0% in 2001–2003 (Nyamweya 2013).  \\nHIV-2 infection has also been reported in countries with historical and socio-eco-\\nnomic ties to West Africa, among them mainly Portugal (2008: 1813 cumulative\\ncases), but also France (2008: 572 cases in the ANRS cohort, 2% of all new infec-\\ntions), Spain (2013: 297 cases), Great Britain (2010: 137 cases), USA, India and Korea\\n(Carvalho 2010, Drylewicz 2008, de Mendoza 2014, Gilleece 2010).\\nDiagnosis \\nGenerally, Western Blot analysis leads to definite discrimination between an HIV-1\\nor HIV-2 infection (see Chapter Test). However, it may be difficult to distinguish\\nbetween mono- and dual infection. Due to the close relationship cross-reactivity\\n513'),\n",

In those cases, type\\nspecific PCR assays may help. There are no commercial PCR tests available, but some\\nlabs offer in-house tests. Viremia levels are usually lower than those seen with HIV-1\\n(see below), the detection limit is usually 100 copies/ml.   \\nHIV-2 testing is strongly recommended in all patients (especially those from West\\nAfrican countries), showing HIV-associated or AIDS-defining illnesses (and/or low\\nCD4 T cells) in the presence of low or undetectable HIV-1 viremia and/or an\\n indeterminate or nonreactive HIV-1 Western Blot.\\nNatural Course \\nIn general, there are no differences between HIV-2 and HIV-1 with regard to the\\n clinical manifestation. If left untreated, HIV-2-infected patients with low CD4 T cells\\ndevelop illnesses similar to those seen in HIV-1-infected patients. Almost all AIDS-\\ndefining infections and malignancies have been seen in HIV-2-infected patients.\\nGiven the endemic setting of HIV-2, some AIDS events such as TB, wasting syndrome\\nand chronic diarrhea may be seen more frequently (Markovitz 1994, Ndour 2000,\\nMatheron 2003). As HIV-1, HIV-2 is a neurotropic virus and can be isolated from\\ncerebrospinal fluid in some patients (Arvidson 2004). \\nA reduced rate of clinical progression indicates that HIV-2 has a reduced virulence\\ncompared to HIV-1. The asymptomatic incubation period after infection with HIV-\\n2 appears to be substantially longer. In a prospective clinical study on HIV+ woman\\nfrom 1985 to 1993, HIV-1-infected women had a 67% probability of AIDS-free sur-\\nvival 5 years after seroconversion in contrast with 100% for HIV-2-infected women\\n(Marlink 1994). So-called long-term non-progressors (LTNPs) and elite controllers\\n(undetectable viral load in the absence of ARVs) are seen much more frequently than\\nin HIV-1-infected patients (Marlink 1994, Hansmann 2005). Among 342 HIV-2-\\ninfected patients of a French HIV-2 cohort, the prevalence of LTNPs (i.e., asympto-\\nmatic for at least 8 years while maintaining CD4 T cell counts of at least 500 cells/µl)\\nand of elite controllers (controlling HIV replication without ART for at least 10 years)\\nwere 6.1% (95% confidence interval 3.9-9.1) and 9.1% (95% CI 6.3–12.7), respec-\\ntively. Most LTNPs (81%) were elite controllers, whereas only 55% of HIV controllers\\nwere LTNPs (Thiebault 2011). \\nHIV-2 viremia levels are much lower than those of HIV-1. In several studies, the\\nmedian viral load was 30-100 fold lower, irrespective of the length of time infected\\nor disease stage (Andersson 2000, Popper 2000, Hansmann 2005). A high viral load\\ncan already be considered when the HIV-2 RNA copy number is above 1,000/ml\\n(Gilleece 2010). In total, mortality in patients with an undetectable viremia (<100\\ncopies/ml) seems to be similar to that of the general population (van der Loeff 2010).\\nHowever, there are also some patients showing clinical progression with low viremia\\nor even with an absence of detectable viremia (Soares 2011, Hegedus 2014), impli-\\ncating a dichotomy between amount of plasma virus and cell-associated viral burden.\\nIn general, CD4 T cells in HIV-2 infected patients are higher than in patients with\\nHIV-1. Clinical progression mainly depends on plasma viremia and can be seen even\\nat high CD4 stages (Sousa 2002, Hansmann 2005, van der Loeff 2010, Hegedus 2014).\\nThe main transmission routes of HIV-2 are sexual contacts, needle sharing, perina-\\ntal infections or blood products. The heterosexual spread of HIV-2 is significantly\\nslower (3-9 fold) than that of HIV-1, which strongly suggests differences in the viruses’\\ninfectivity potential (Marlink 1994, Gilbert 2003). This may be due to the fact that\\nHIV-2 levels are lower not only in plasma but also in the semen and in the female\\ngenital tract (Gottlieb 2006, Raugi 2013). In addition, the rates of mother-to-child\\ntransmission (MCT) of HIV-2 is lower compared to HIV-1. In a study from The Gambia\\n514 Other Infections than HIV-1'),\n",

In a French cohort of 223 pregnant women, the mother-to-child\\ntransmission rate for HIV-2 was only 0.6% although many women remained\\nuntreated during pregnancy and delivered vaginally (Burgard 2010). \\nPathogenesis \\nIs HIV-2 a model for a possible host control of HIV infection? If so, this would be\\ndue to two main factors: 1. A better immune response of the host and/or 2. A lower\\nintrinsic pathogenetic potential of HIV-2. Current data suggest that both factors are\\ninvolved. Several differences between HIV-2 and HIV-1 infection are evident:\\n\\x81 Viral replication (plasma RNA, intracellular mRNA) \\n\\x81 Level of immune activation \\n\\x81 Response of the adaptive immune system (T cells and neutralizing antibodies), \\n\\x81 Activity of the innate immunity\\n\\x81 Activity and functions of viral proteins \\nIn a French cohort of untreated patients (320 cases with HIV-1 and 160 with HIV-\\n2), CD4 T cell counts decreased less rapidly in HIV-2 than in HIV-1 patients. The\\ndecline was -9 versus -49 cells/µl per year (Drylewicz 2008). The rate of decline cor-\\nrelates with the level of immune activation (Sousa 2001, Soares 2011) and with the\\nlevel of plasma viremia (Gottlieb 2002). \\nThe immune response to HIV-2 appears more protective against disease progression\\nsuggesting that pivotal immune factors limit viral pathology (review: Nyamweya\\n2013). \\nPolyfunctional HIV-specific CD4 T cell responses are a hallmark of non-progressive\\nHIV-2 infection and may be related to good clinical outcome in this setting (Duvall\\n2006). HIV-2 viral control is also significantly associated with a greater CD8 T cell\\nreceptor heterogeneity and functional flexibility (Lopes 2003) and strong CD8 gag\\nresponses (Ledigdowicz 2010).\\nImmune activation is central to the pathogenesis of HIV. The lower decline of CD4\\nT cells in HIV-2-infected patients is associated with lower levels of immune activa-\\ntion, evaluated by HLA-DR expression on lymphocytes and sera concentrations of\\nIgG and beta2-microglobulin. Ex vivo apoptosis in all lymphocyte subsets, including\\nCD4 and CD8 T cells as well as B cells, is lower in HIV-2 than in HIV-1 infection\\n(Michel 2000, Jaffar 2005 Ledigdowicz 2010). HIV-2 non-progressors have minimal\\nimmune activation; high viral load HIV-2 progressors have higher immune activa-\\ntion levels, similar to or exceeding those in HIV-1 infection (Hegedus 2014). In addi-\\ntion, programmed death (PD)-1/PD-L1 molecules, rather than markers of T cell\\nexhaustion, may act as modulators of T cell immune activation, contributing to the\\nslower course of HIV-2 infection (Tendeiro 2012).\\nIn most studies, a considerable proportion (up to 40–50% of HIV-2 infection is\\naviremic (which typically means a viral load of below 100 copies/ml). In many of\\nthese patients, however, plasma RNA is detectable by sensitive assays such as quali-\\ntative RT PCR. HIV-2 plasma RNA is 30-fold lower than HIV-1. In contrast, the median\\nproviral HIV-2 DNA is 200 copies/10\\n5 PBMC and similar to those with HIV-1 (Popper\\n2000, Gottlieb 2002, Matheron 2003). Difference in the pathogenicity of HIV-1 and\\nHIV-2 may be explained by differences in viral replication, mainly at late stages after\\nintegration and before late transcription (Soares 2012). Despite the lower levels of\\nplasma RNA, HIV-2 is able to establish a stable latent infection in vivo(MacNeil 2007).\\nPatients with higher viral load (>1000 copies/ml) show marked differences compared\\nto patients with low viral load (<100 copies/ml).

There is no cross-reactivity between HIV-1 and HIV-2 (Rodriguez 2007).\\nHIV-2 isolates appear to have two mechanisms of immune evasion that are dimin-\\nished in effectiveness relative to HIV-1: glycan shielding and conformational masking\\n(Kong 2012). Potency and breadth of neutralizing antibodies decrease as the disease\\nprogresses. Resistance to antibody neutralization occurs in late stage disease and is\\nusually associated with X4 viral tropism and major changes in V3 sequence and con-\\nformation (Marcelino 2012). \\nNatural killer cell function is well preserved in asymptomatic HIV-2 infection but\\nsimilar to that of HIV-1 infection when CD4 T cell counts fall (Nuvor 2006). There\\nare also differences with regard to restriction factors such as TRIM5, SAMHD-1 or\\nthe APOBEC3F/3G family of deaminase enzymes (Ylinen 2005, Nyamweya 2013,\\nBertine 2015). \\nViral factors\\nViral evolution occurs slowly in HIV-2 infection, which is consistent with the slow\\ndisease progression of HIV-2 and supports the notion that viral evolution may be a\\nrelevant correlate for disease progression. Longitudinal studies have shown a remark-\\nable stability of env-C2V3 sequences over many years (MacNeil 2007). Accumulation\\nof viral mRNA is attenuated in HIV-2 infection relative to that in HIV-1 infection.\\nThe differences in viral mRNA are consistent with the differences in plasma viral\\nloads between HIV-1 and HIV-2 and suggest that lower plasma viral loads, and pos-\\nsibly the attenuated pathogenesis of HIV-2, can be explained by lower rates of viral\\nreplication in vivo. Changes in the genome of HIV-2 may have higher consequences\\non replicative fitness (MacNeil 2007). \\nThe multifunctional accessory Nef protein may play an important role in the\\nimmunopathogenesis of HIV-2 infection. Nef proteins are able to downregulate the\\nT cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 complex of the infected cell, thereby reducing the poten-\\ntial for deleterious activation. This Nef-mediated downmodulation is higher in HIV-2\\ninfection and may help viremic HIV-2-infected individuals maintain normal CD4 \\nT cell homeostasis by preventing T cell activation and by suppressing the induction\\nof death receptors that may affect the functionality and survival of both virally\\ninfected and uninfected bystander cells (Khalid 2012). \\nDual infection with HIV-1 and HIV-2\\nDual infection with HIV-1 and HIV-2 was first confirmed in 1988, but difficulties in\\ndistinguishing between dual seropositivity and dual infection have hampered efforts\\nto estimate the prevalence of this phenomenon. As a consequence, studies of clini-\\ncal progression and outcomes are scarce (Raugi 2013). In a systematic review and\\nmeta-analysis, patients with dual infection had a similar mortality compared to HIV-1-\\ninfected patients which was higher than those of HIV-2-monoinfected persons. There\\nwas no evidence that HIV-2 delays progression to death in dually infected individ-\\nuals (Prince 2014). In a cohort study from Senegal, after adjusting for CD4 T cell\\ncount, age and sex, HIV-1 RNA levels were significantly higher than HIV-2 levels in\\nsemen, cervicovaginal lavage, and oral fluids. Results suggest that with disease\\n progression, HIV-1 outcompetes HIV-2 in dually infected individuals (Raugi 2013).\\n516 Other Infections than HIV-1'),\n",

The three integrase inhibitors ral-\\ntegravir, elvitegravir and dolutegravir are also effective, as is the CCR5-antagonist\\nmaraviroc in patients with R5 tropism. Data on antiretroviral therapy in HIV-2\\ninfected patients is very limited (reviews: Camacho 2012, Ekouevi 2014, Menéndez-\\nArias 2014) and is based mainly on small and uncontrolled studies (Desbois 2008,\\nJallow 2009, Benard 2011, Charpentier 2011, Trevino 2011, Camacho 2012,\\nMenéndez-Arias 2013). There are no randomized trials. \\nIn ARCHIV2E, an observational study on 44 patients starting triple NRTI therapy\\n(73% ABC+3TC+AZT) and 126 patients starting PI/r-based regimens (61%\\nlopinavir/r), PI/r-containing regimens showed superior efficacy over triple NRTI\\n regimens as first-line therapy. More patients achieved an undetectable viral load and\\nimmune reconstitution was better with PIs (Benard 2011).  \\nThe validity of HIV-2 plasma viral load as a control for treatment success is more\\nlimited compared to HIV-1. Viremia is lower and the decline is less impressive during\\nART (Drylewicz 2008, Camacho 2012). Viral replication, clinical progression and\\neven resistance development may be seen in patients with low or even undetectable\\nviremia (Popper 2000, Soares 2011). In addition, immune reconstitution is slower\\nand less impressive with ART (Matheron 2006, Drylewicz 2008).\\nResistance\\nMutational pathways may differ from those seen in HIV-1infection. No commercial\\nresistance tests are available. Recently, some efforts have been made regarding stan-\\ndardized HIV-2 drug resistance interpretation (Charpentier 2015). Some authors rec-\\nommend resistance testing prior to initiation of ART. Prevalence of transmitted resist-\\nance mutations have been reported to be between 3 and 6% (Charpentier 2013).\\nAccording to EACS, resistance testing should be considered after treatment failure\\n(Vandamme 2011). In the event of virologic, immunologic, or clinical failure, second-line\\ntreatment should be instituted in consultation with an expert in HIV-2 management.\\nNNRTIs: HIV-2 is intrinsically resistant to NNRTIs. This may be due to polymorphisms\\nin the RT gene at the position 181 and 188. Resistance applies also to newer NNRTIs\\nsuch as etravirine and rilpivirine which only showed minimal activity in vitro. \\nNRTIs: Several polymorphisms for HIV-2 have been described, among them T69N,\\nV75I, V118I, L210N, T215S, K219E (Benard 2011, Camacho 2012, Menéndez-Arias\\n2014). In many cases, resistance is based on steric inhibition and Q151M (50%),\\nK65R (13%) and M184I/V (25%) are the most frequently seen resistance-associated\\nmutations. These RAMs occur more rapidly in HIV-2 infection and the genetic barrier\\nseems to be lower. Thymidine-associated mutations (S215Y/F) are rarely selected and\\nhave been described only in a few patients (Jallow 2009, Ntemgwa 2009, Gilleece\\n2010, Trevino 2011, Menéndez-Arias 2014, Charpentier 2015).\\nHIV-2 Infection    517'),\n",

These agents should be preferably used in HIV-2\\ninfection. However, as with NRTIs, resistance develops more rapidly (Ntemgwa 2007,\\nCamacho 2012) mainly due to preexistent polymorphisms in HIV-2protease (Raugi\\n2013, Menendez-Arias 2013). In contrast to HIV-1, even one or two RAMs seem to\\ninduce moderate or high resistance (Raugi 2013). This applies for V47A (lopinavir),\\nI54M (lopinavir and darunavir) and L90M (saquinavir) (Menéndez-Arias 2013).\\nCommon protease substitutions are V47A, I54M, I82F, L90M, L99F, V47A+L90M,\\nV47A+L99F, I54M+L90M+L99F, I54M+I82F+L90M (Trevino 2011). The RAM combi-\\nnation I54M+I84V+L90M induces high resistance to lopinavir, darunavir und\\nsaquinavir. The HIV-2EU group associates G48V , I84V and L90M with resistance to\\nsaquinavir, V47A, I54M, I82F, I84V , L90M (and V62A+L99F) with resistance to\\nlopinavir, and I50V , I54M, I84V and L90M with  resistance to darunavir (Charpentier\\n2015). As a decrease of IC50 (hypersusceptibility) has been shown for saquinavir in\\nthe presence of V47A, some authors speculate on PI sequencing (Camacho 2012),\\ni.e., first-line lopinavir, then second-line saquinavir. \\nINSTIs: the genetic pathways to integrase inhibitor resistance in HIV-2 and the extent\\nof cross-resistance between different INSTIs seem to be similar to HIV-1 (Charpentier\\n2011). There is cross-resistance between  raltegravir and elvitegravir. Both agents\\nseem to have a low genetic resistance barrier. The main RAMs are N155H/R, Q148K/R,\\nE92Q+T97A,  Y143C/G/R+E92Q and Y143C/G/R+T97A for raltegravir, E92G/Q,\\nQ148K/R, N155H and  T97A+Y143C for elvitegravir. Dolutegravir was used in patients\\nwith resistance to first-line integrase inhibitors (Descamps 2015). Mutations associ-\\nated with resistance to dolutegravir refer to Q148K, G140S+Q148R, E92Q+N155H,\\nand T97A+N155H (Charpentier 2015).\\nCCR5 antagonists: HIV-2 tropism was assessed in 83 antiretroviral-experienced\\npatients with virological failure. Tropism was predicted as X4 in 58% of patients and\\nwas associated with a CD4 cell count of less than 100 cells/µl, and with a higher\\nnumber of drug resistance mutations. This high prevalence of X4 virus might\\n compromise the use of CCR5 inhibitors (Visseaux 2012). There are some anecdotal\\nreports that maraviroc is effective in HIV-2 with R5 tropism (Menéndez-Arias 2013,\\nDescamps 2015). \\nGuidelines  \\nIn the current US DHHS guidelines (2015), a first-line therapy with a boosted PI/r\\n(lopinavir/r, darunavir/r or saquinavir/r) plus 2 NRTIs is preferred. INSTI-based reg-\\nimens are alternatives. Triple NRTIs, an option in the WHO Guidelines 2013, are rec-\\nommended if lopinavir/r is not available. Monitoring of HIV-2RNA levels, CD4 T cell\\ncounts, and clinical improvements can be used to assess treatment response, as is\\nrecommended for HIV-1 infection. Although the optimal CD4 T cell count thresh-\\nold for initiating ART in HIV-2 infection is unknown, therapy should be started before\\nthere is clinical progression.\\nThe British Guidelines (2010) recommend treatment initiation when HIV-2 plasma\\nRNA is above 1,000 copies/ml. The preferred first-line regimen is TDF+FTC plus\\nlopinavir/r, alternatives are AZT+3TC and darunavir/r (Gilleece 2010).\\nThere is an uncertainty whether all patients with HIV-2 infection showed receive\\nART, regardless of their immune status. This applies in particular to elite controllers\\nthat are seen in considerable proportions in this setting. \\nOverall, clinical and immunologic and virologic outcomes in HIV-2 infected indi-\\nviduals treated with ART are suboptimal. There is a need for controlled trials to\\nimprove the management and outcomes (Ekouevi 2014).\\n518 Other Infections than HIV-1'),\n",

HIV and Gynecology \\nRAMONA PAULI \\nHIV+ women have a higher risk of cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer, genital\\nulcers, vaginal infections and genital condyloma than negative women. A gynecol-\\nogical examination including a Papanicolaou (Pap) smear and screening for sexually\\ntransmitted infections are part of the routine evaluation of female HIV+ patients at\\nthe time of first diagnosis as well as during the course of the disease.  \\nProphylaxis\\nGuidelines on Pap smear and breast cancer screening for the general population vary\\nfrom country to country. In general, Pap smear screening starts at age 20 or 25 and\\ncontinues until about age 50 or 60. Breast cancer screening starts in Germany at age\\n35. Regular gynecological checkups, including Pap smears, are especially important\\nfor HIV+ women because of their higher risk of cervical and anal dysplasia. In\\n contrast, the risk of breast cancer in HIV+ women is not elevated, it seems to be\\nlower than in negative women (Goedert 2006). \\nPhysicians working with HIV+ women should stress the importance of gynecologi-\\ncal evaluations. It cannot be taken for granted that all women will visit the\\n gynecologist regularly even when it is covered by health insurance. In Germany for\\nexample only 50% of women take advantage of regular Pap smear and breast cancer\\nscreening. Therefore it is crucial to talk about the necessity and the reasons for gyne-\\ncological screening. The frequency of screening depends on the clinical scenario. \\nIf the initial Pap smear after HIV diagnosis is normal, then a second screening should\\nbe done approximately 6 months later. If both results are normal, then an annual\\nPap smear is sufficient. Consider more frequent screening in women with a higher\\nrisk of cervical dysplasia, e.g., with abnormal Pap smear results, HPV infection, symp-\\ntomatic HIV infection, CD4 T cell count <200/µl or after treatment for cervical\\n dysplasia. \\nTable 1: Gynecological/Pap smear screening\\nScreening frequency Clinical scenario \\nEvery year Routine control  \\n6 months First year of HIV diagnosis, then every year \\n<6 months Abnormal Pap smear \\nHPV infection  \\nAfter therapy for cervical dysplasia \\nSymptomatic HIV infection \\nCD4 T cells <200/μl \\nBasic gynecological evaluation \\nA full gynecological examination consists of inspection of the external genital and\\nperianal region, bimanual examination of the inner genital area, rectal examination,\\ncolposcopy, microscopic examination of vaginal secretions and a Pap smear. In HIV+\\nwomen palpation of inguinal and axillary lymph nodes is important, since enlarged\\nlymph nodes are often present and may need a rapid mammographic/ultrasound\\nevaluation. At age 35 a basic mammogram should be performed. Since 2013, German-\\nAustrian guidelines recommend an annual anal cytologic smear for all HIV+ men\\nand women.\\n522'),\n",

Older studies\\ndemonstrate a cycle prolongation (Shah 1994), whereas the WIHS study shows at\\nmost a slight increase of very short cycles (Harlow 2000). It is also unknown whether\\nor not HIV accelerates the beginning of menopause. There is only limited data in\\nsmall populations (Clark 2000, Greenblatt 2000). In contrast, it is clear that post-\\nmenopause as well as HIV infection and antiretroviral treatment have adverse effects\\non bone, lipid and glucose metabolism and may contribute to osteoporosis and\\n cardiovascular disease.  \\nContraception \\nWhen choosing a contraceptive method be aware of the expectations of the woman.\\nCondoms are the most common form of contraception (and they protect from STIs).\\nNevertheless their contraceptive effectiveness is comparatively limited. Condoms\\nhave a Pearl Index (number of pregnancies per 100 patient years) of 1–12 while con-\\ntraceptive pills have a Pearl Index of 0.1–0.9. Other methods are contraceptive pills\\ncontaining varying hormone combinations and dosages, depot and transdermal for-\\nmulations as well as intrauterine devices (IUD). Hormone-containing contraception\\nhas no influence on the course of HIV infection, but this method may increase the\\nrisk of transmitting or acquiring HIV (Stringer 2009, Heffron 2012). Intrauterine\\ndevices made of copper as well as the levonorgestrel-containing device (Mirena\\n®),\\nwhich increases cervical mucus viscosity, have proved to be safe and effective in\\nHIV+ women (Stringer 2007, Heikinheimo 2006).\\nIn HIV+ patients on ART, interactions should be taken into account. Oral contra-\\nceptives interact with PIs and NNRTIs with almost unpredictable consequences. There\\nare limited reliable studies of such interactions, and these interactions are agent-spe-\\ncific (El-Ibiary 2008, Heikinheimo 2008). The same is true of new parenteral oral\\ncontraceptives like the hormone-containing vaginal ring (NuvaRing\\n®), the etono-\\ngestrel implant (Implanon®), transdermal hormone patches and emergency contra-\\nception and abortion pills. It is essential to inform patients about potential interac-\\ntions when starting ART. Exceptions are unboosted atazanavir and indinavir,\\netravirine, maraviroc and raltegravir in combinations without ritonavir. \\nIn an ACTG study depot formulations containing 150 mg medroxyprogesterone\\nacetate (e.g., Depo-Provera\\n®) proved equally safe and reliable with patients on\\nefavirenz, nevirapine or nelfinavir (Watts 2008).   \\nInfections\\nIn the pre-ART era genital infections, especially genital herpes, vulvovaginal can-\\ndidiasis and bacterial vaginosis, were more common in HIV+ women. The preva-\\nlence and severity of these infections correlate with the CD4 T cell count and HIV\\nviral load. Today only vaginal candidiasis seems to be more common, which may\\nbe a consequence of a higher rate of antibiotic treatment (Watts 2006). Sexually trans-\\nmitted infections (STI) are more common as well, though this depends on the sexual\\nactivity of the patient.    \\nBacterial Vaginosis\\nBacterial vaginosis (BV) results from replacement of the normal lactobacillus-domi-\\nnant vaginal flora by mixed flora, including anaerobic bacteria. This increases HIV\\nexpression in the genital tract and may promote HIV transmission (Olinger 1999,\\nCu-Uvin 2001). Persistence and severity of bacterial vaginosis increases with the\\nHIV and Gynecology    523'),\n",

Genital herpes increases\\nthe risk of HIV infection and transmission (Heng 1994). ART lowers the frequency\\nand severity of symptomatic episodes although there may be asymptomatic viral\\nshedding (CDC 2015).\\nAccording to more recent studies reactivation of HSV-2 is associated with higher HIV\\nreplication (Rebbaprada 2007). Suppression of HSV-2 lowers HIV viral load in genital\\nsecretions and breast milk and has a positive impact on HIV progression (Nagot 2008,\\nDrake 2011, Reynolds 2011). Whether this lowers the risk of HIV transmission is a\\nmatter that continues to be investigated. However, the suppressive treatment of HSV-\\n2 does not influence the susceptibility to HIV infection in HSV-2-infected individu-\\nals (Celum 2008, Watson-Jones 2008).\\nTable 3: Therapy of genital herpes in persons infected with HIV (CDC 2015)   \\nMedication Dose \\nPrimary infection Acyclovir 400–800 mg orally 2–3 times a day \\nFamcyclovir 500 mg orally BID \\nValacyclovir 500 mg orally BID \\nRecurrent infection Acyclovir 400 mg orally TID for 5–10 days \\nFamcyclovir 500 mg orally BID for 5–10 days\\nValacyclovir 1.0 g orally BID for 5–10 days \\nSevere infection Acyclovir 5–10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours \\nAcyclovir resistance Foscarnet 40 mg/kg IV every 8 hours \\nCidofovir Topical Cidofovir gel 1%* over 5 days \\n* not available commercially, must be made up by pharmacist  \\n524 Women and Children'),\n",

Typical lesions present as painful vesicles in groups on red skin, which\\nulcerate and heal without scarring. Primary infection may also be associated with\\nsigns of systemic viral infection like fever, headache, etc. \\nDiagnosis by clinical signs alone has low specificity and sensitivity (Sen 2007).\\nTherefore, a clinical diagnosis should be confirmed by virologic and serologic  tests,\\npreferably by type-specific assays. Diagnosis should distinguish between syphilis and\\na ‘chancroid’ condition (Haemophilus ducreyi).\\nVulvovaginal Candidiasis \\nVulvovaginal candidiasis is more common and more persistent but not more severe\\nin HIV+ women (Watts 2006). Low CD4 T cell count promotes the disease, though\\nthe more prevalent use of antibiotics and antifungals in immunodeficient patients\\nmay play an important role. Causative organisms are Candida strains in most cases,\\nwith Candida albicans being the most prevalent strain, but the incidence of non-albi-\\ncans strains is rising. Typical clinical symptoms are pruritus, vulvar burning, vaginal\\nsoreness and thick white-yellow discharge. Dyspareunia and external dysuria may\\nalso be present.\\nDiagnosis can generally be made on the basis of physical examination and\\n colposcopy. Thrush patches are usually found loosely adhering to the vulva and/or\\nvagina. Bimanual examination is not painful. Budding yeast or pseudohyphae are\\ndocumented on a wet mount or KOH preparation or gram stain of vaginal discharge.\\nIn case of recurrent disease yeast culture is mandatory. In case of dysuria a urine test\\nis recommended. \\nThe treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis in is not different from  negative women.\\nTreatment of choice for uncomplicated acute vulvovaginal  candidiasis is a short\\ncourse of an -azole drug for 1–3 days. Alternatives are triazoles orally, e.g., 150 mg\\nsingle dose or itraconazole 2 x 200 mg. In patients with advanced immunodeficiency\\ntopical treatment may be extended to 7 days.

Development of resistance against\\nfluconazole is rare (Sobel 2001, Vazquez 2001). In contrast, resistance is more\\ncommon in non-albicans strains. In this case itraconazole and ketoconazole are a\\ngood alternative. \\nHPV-associated diseases \\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) infections are very common. More than 50% of\\n sexually active individuals get infected by one or more of the more than 100 HPV-\\nsubtypes. Normally the infection resolves within a few months  (Evander 1995, Ho\\n1998). Chronic HPV infection may lead to condylomata acuminata as well as intraep-\\nithelial and invasive cancer in the lower female genital tract. Genital warts are caused\\nmostly by the low-risk subtypes 6 and 11. The high-risk subtypes 16 and 18 play an\\nimportant role in the development of cervical cancer. \\nHIV+ women have a higher prevalence and incidence of HPV (Ahdieh 2001, Branca\\n2003), a higher HPV viral load (Jamieson 2002), a longer persistence of HPV (Sun\\n1997, Ahdieh 2000) and more frequent infections involving multiple subtypes (Levi\\n2004) and oncogenic subtypes (Minkoff 1998, Uberti-Foppa 1998, McKenzie 2009).\\nPrevalence and persistence of HPV correlate with HIV viral load and immune status\\n(Palefsky 1999). In women with advanced HIV disease, oncogenic subtypes are more\\ncommon (Luque 1999) and HPV reactivation is possible (Strickler 2005). HPV viral\\nload correlates with persistence and is higher in patients with low CD4 T cell counts\\n(Ahdieh 2001). \\nTesting for HPV is useful in patients over the age of 30 with a normal Pap smear\\nsince it allows detection of persistent high-risk subtypes for higher grade dysplasia\\n(Ronco 2010). Specificity of the Hybrid Cap ture 2  (HC 2) assay is generally higher\\nthan that of the HPV PCR, while the sensitivity is comparable. \\nCondylomata acuminata \\nHPV-associated genital warts are more prevalent in HIV+ women, and the manifes-\\ntation correlates with immune deficiency (Conley 2002, Silverberg 2002). Diagnosis\\nis possible in most cases by inspection. A biopsy is only necessary if: \\n\\x81 diagnosis is uncertain\\n\\x81 warts do not respond to treatment \\n\\x81 warts progress in spite of therapy \\n\\x81 warts are pigmented, indurated, fixed, or ulcerated \\nFor treatment of condylomata acuminata, see section on STIs.  \\nCervical dysplasia and cervical cancer \\nThe risk of development of HPV-associated cancer is significantly higher in HIV+\\nwomen. Most common is cervical dysplasia, but other regions like the vulva and the\\nperianal area are also affected (Maiman 1998, Massad 1999). In the pre-ART era 20%\\nof HIV+ women developed cervical dysplasia within three years (Ellerbrock 2000).\\nManifestation and severity correlate with advanced immunodeficiency and high viral\\nload (Davis 2001, Massad 2001, Schuman 2003). Reasons for the correlation are the\\nhigher prevalence of oncogenic subtypes and the higher HPV viral load (especially\\nHPV-16) in patients with advanced HIV disease (Weissenborn 2003, Fontaine 2005,\\nHarris 2005). HIV+ women have a nine times higher risk of invasive cervical carci-\\nnoma than negative women (Mbulaiteye 2003). Cervical cancer is an AIDS-defining\\nillness. The incidence of cervical cancer in WIHS and HERS was 1.2 per 1000 person\\n526 Women and Children'),\n",

Therefore the risk of anal dysplasia in addition to cervical dysplasia is higher.\\nThe prevalence of dysplastic cells in cytological samples in the ART era reaches up\\nto 16%, including women who do not partake in anal intercourse (Hessol 2009, Weis\\n2011). The risk for anal carcinoma is elevated by 2-28-fold in HIV+ women (Frisch\\n2000, Dal Maso 2003). \\nDiagnostic evaluation \\nGynecological/cytological screening is indicated every six months in the first year\\nafter HIV diagnosis.

HIV and Pregnancy\\nTherapy for mothers and prophylaxis for neonates\\nMECHTHILD VOCKS-HAUCK\\nPerinatal (vertical) HIV infection has become rare since the introduction of anti-\\nretrovirals as transmission prophylaxis and elective cesarean section. While vertical\\nHIV transmission rates hovered around 15% in Europe at the beginning of the\\nnineties, it is now at less than 1% (Connor 1994, European Collaborative Study 2005,\\nTownsend 2014). Postpartum HIV infections are avoidable provided HIV-infected\\nmothers do not breastfeed without prophylaxis. At the same time as transmission\\nprophylaxis was introduced, the treatment of HIV infection changed. Nowadays,\\npregnancy is no longer a general contraindication for ART (Agangi 2005, CDC 2014).\\nThis chapter summarizes the German-Austrian guidelines for HIV therapy in preg-\\nnancy (DAIG 2014). Reference is made to the US (CDC 2014) and European (EACS\\n2014) Guidelines. Continuously updated recommendations can be found at\\nwww.europeanaidsclinicalsociety.org/guidelines.asp or www.AIDSinfo.nih.gov. \\nHIV therapy in pregnancy \\nStarting HIV therapy during pregnancy\\nIt is important to distinguish between women with and without a therapy indica-\\ntion of their own. In the case of a maternal indication, treatment is generally begun\\nin week 13+0 of pregnancy; if there is no maternal indication, i.e., solely transmis-\\nsion prophylaxis and low viral load, start at the latest at week 24+0 of pregnancy,\\nand with a higher viral load (of more than 100,000 copies/ml) or high-risk  pregnancy\\nas of week 24+0 or earlier (DAIG 2014).\\nAccording to the US and/or European Guidelines transmission prophylaxis should\\nbe started at the beginning of the second trimester. The assessment of indications\\nfor therapy and drug selection is similar to that in non-pregnant patients (see chapter\\non ART 2015). Since the CD4 T cell count decreases physiologically by approximately\\n10–20% in pregnant patients, the threshold values should be adjusted upwards\\naccordingly before treatment is started. Following the recommendations of the\\nGerman-Austrian guidelines, antiretroviral therapy in symptom-free patients should\\nbegin when CD4 T cell count falls below 350–500/µl (15–20% relative). Before\\n initiating therapy, a resistance test, and if necessary, subtyping, should be carried\\nout (see chapter on Resistance).\\nWhen setting up a treatment plan, it is important that:\\n\\x81 AZT (Retrovir\\n®) is part of the combination, but despite lack of approval in preg-\\nnancy, other NRTIs are also acceptable – if the result of the resistance test and the\\nexpected toxicity are favorable; and\\n\\x81 Efavirenz (Sustiva\\n®, Stocrin®) is avoided because of possible teratogenic effects in\\nthe first trimester; and \\n\\x81 The combination of ddI+d4T is avoided and d4T should only be used when there\\nare no appropriate alternatives, and for the shortest possible time.\\nA maximum suppression of viral activity (to <50 copies/ml) makes HIV transmission\\nunlikely. In this case the intrapartum intravenous transmission prophylaxis with\\nAZT can be waived (EACS 2014, see below). \\n531'),\n",

Women in whom pregnancy is diagnosed during the first trimester\\nshould be informed about the benefits and risks of treatment in this period. In cases\\nof reduced immune status in particular, ART could be continued in the first trimester\\nunder careful laboratory and ultrasonic controls. Embryonic toxicity seems to be low\\noverall (Joao 2010, Watts 2011, Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry 2015). However,\\nagents with a toxic effect on the embryo should not be administered during early\\npregnancy (Table 1).\\nInterruption of treatment in the first trimester\\nWomen who have to discontinue ART during pregnancy, e.g., because of hyper-\\nemesis, should only restart ART when good drug tolerance is expected. In this case,\\nas in all others, the rule is to withdraw all drugs (NRTIs and PIs) simultaneously and\\nre-administer them simultaneously, with the exception of NNRTIs. Due to their long\\nhalf-lives, NNRTIs should be withdrawn up to three weeks before NRTIs in order to\\nprevent development of resistance. Alternatively, the NNRTI can be replaced by a\\nboosted PI. In other cases – especially if pregnancy is diagnosed very early – the fear\\nof possible embryotoxic effects may also lead to ART interruption until the end of\\nthe first trimester. Neural tube defects due to efavirenz can occur in the first 8 weeks\\nof pregnancy. \\nHowever, there are reports that after interruption of treatment in pregnancy, return\\nto complete viral suppression may be much more difficult (Liuzzi 2006) and the risk\\nof transmission is higher (Galli 2009). As it is usually not possible to determine preg-\\nnancy duration exactly, restarting is mostly initiated at the gestational point of 13+0\\nweeks. A continuously updated summary of the current state of knowledge about\\nantiretroviral drugs in pregnancy can be found at www.AIDSinfo.nih.gov.\\nCombination therapy for the duration of pregnancy\\nHIV therapy and/or perinatal prevention is recommended to be based on a boosted\\nPI. The prolonged half-life of NNRTIs makes them less suitable for a short course of\\ntreatment for prevention only. The prevention of mother-to-child transmission starts\\nfrom the second trimester (CDC 2014) onward or 24-28+0 weeks of gestation (DAIG\\n2014). Before starting therapy the risk of teratogenicity has to be weighed carefully\\nagainst the risk of HIV transmission. The approach of an earlier start of HIV pre-\\nvention is based on the assumption that any timely decrease in viral load translates\\ninto a lowering of the transmission risk (Tubiana 2010, Chibwesha 2011, Read 2012,\\nRachas 2013, Townsend 2014).

Resistance and plasma level are determined at the  beginning\\nand, if appropriate, at the point of failure of treatment.\\nSpecial aspects of HIV prophylaxis/therapy in pregnancy\\nBecause embryotoxicity cannot be excluded and hepatic metabolism is altered in\\npregnancy, and in some cases plasma levels are reduced, some basic rules must be\\ntaken into consideration (CDC 2014) (Table 1). \\nIt is important to understand that a detectable plasma viral load always necessitates\\na resistance test. AZT resistance was verified in approximately 17% of women who\\nreceived AZT monoprophylaxis between 1991 and 1997 (Palumbo 2001). In the year\\n2006, resistance mutations were diagnosed in up to 23% of perinatally HIV-infected\\nchildren, mutations which limited future therapeutic options and thus potentially\\nworsened their prognosis (Vignoles 2007). \\nHIV and hepatitis virus coinfections\\nIn chronic hepatitis B (HBV) coinfection and pregnancy, tenofovir (TDF) and lamivu-\\ndine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC) are recommended as NRTI backbone in HIV therapy\\n(Shi 2010).

According to experience to date, the main problems are anemia and,\\nwhen using combination therapy, lactic acidosis.\\nOn the basis of pregnancies observed to date, it can be maintained that frequently\\nused NRTIs such as AZT, 3TC and d4T do not increase teratogenicity by more than\\ntwo-fold (Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry 2015). Most of our experience is with\\nAZT. Follow-up of more than 20,000 children who received AZT prophylaxis did not\\nshow any serious side effects. An analysis of the causes of death of 223 children who\\ndied within the first five years of life ruled out drug-related causes (The Perinatal\\nSafety Review Working Group 2011).

Nevirapine in pregnant women with\\nover 250 CD4 T cells/µl is only recommended following very careful assessment of\\nthe benefit-risk ratio (CDC 2014). In a retrospective study of 197 pregnant women,\\ntoxic side effects were observed in 5.6%, leading to treatment discontinuation in\\n3.6% (Joao 2006). However, another study did not find higher liver toxicity with\\nnevirapine during pregnancy than with other compounds (Quyang 2010). Perinatal\\nsingle- and two-dose nevirapine prophylaxis resulted in the development of resist-\\nance mutations in more than 20% of cases (Flys 2005). This can be reduced by 50%\\nor more by the additional administration of, for example, tenofovir and FTC (Chi\\n2007, Lehman 2009). The intrapartum single-dose administration of nevirapine to\\npregnant women receiving ART is NOT recommended by the CDC (2014) or EACS\\n(2014). If a mother gives birth less than two hours following nevirapine adminis-\\ntration, or has not received any prior nevirapine at all, the newborn should receive\\na dose of nevirapine immediately after birth and a further dose 48–72 hours later\\n(Stringer 2003). \\nEfavirenz should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy, due to embry-\\nonic toxicity in humans (neural tube impairment) and in rhesus monkeys (Bristol-\\nMyers Squibb 2004). Efavirenz may be used used only after the second trimester in\\nthose who have no alternative treatment option, providing reliable contraception is\\npracticed after delivery (Schwarz 2012, CDC 2014). The occurrence of isolated cases\\nof neural tube defects caused the FDA to allocate efavirenz to category D. There are,\\nunfortunately, only case experiences with etravirine and rilpivirine. \\nPIs\\nThe use of PIs must be monitored carefully, especially in the later stages of preg-\\nnancy (monthly in the third trimester), due to possible diabetogenic effects (Beitune\\n2005) and hepatic toxicity. In other studies, however, no increased rate of gestational\\ndiabetes was seen (Hitti 2007, Azria 2009, Jao 2013). Hyperlipidemia occurred more\\nfrequently in another study (Floridia 2006).\\nPresently, most experience relates to nelfinavir (Timmermans 2005). Since nelfinavir\\nis less potent than boosted PIs, it is seldom used today. Indinavir can lead to hyper-\\nbilirubinemia and nephrolithiasis; the plasma levels can be lowered (Kosel 2003,\\nCressey 2013). As with indinavir, saquinavir should also be boosted with ritonavir\\nin pregnancy (Zorilla 2007). A twice daily dosage of saquinavir is highly effective\\n(Brunet 2013), but a single dose is useful, too (Lopez-Cortez 2007). Lopinavir/r plasma\\nlevels are also lowered during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester (Manawi\\n2007, Aweeka 2010). With atazanavir/r, mild hyperbilirubinemia in neonates with\\nlow placental transfer of about 20% has been described (Ripamonti 2007, Ivanovic\\n2009, Mandelbrot 2011). Tipranavir reached higher concentration in umbilical cord\\nblood compared to other PIs (Weizsäcker 2011). Darunavir does not cross the pla-\\ncenta (Ripamonti 2009). Fosamprenavir/r has been described as safe and effective\\n(Martorelli 2010).\\nMonotherapy with lopinavir/r in pregnant women with an initial viral load under\\n30,000 copies/ml and CD4 T cell count over 350 cells/µl reduced the viral load in\\nmore than 88% to less than 200 copies/ml. Side effects with monotherapy were less\\nthan with triple ART (Tubiana 2011).  \\nPrevious speculation on increased rates of deformity when using PIs has been refuted,\\nespecially as PIs can barely cross the placenta due to their molecular size. An increase\\nin premature births when using ART with a PI (EACS 2006, Cotter 2006, Grosch-\\nWörner 2008, Machado 2009, Townsend 2010, Powis 2011, Sibiude 2011) has also\\nfailed to be confirmed in other studies (Tuomala 2005, Kourtis 2007, Baroncelli 2009,\\nHIV and Pregnancy    535'),\n",

Therapy failures\\nwith perinatal HIV transmission have been described. In T-20 there is no placental\\ntransfer (Brennan-Benson 2006). Like T-20, maraviroc is assigned to FDA category B\\n(see below), in macaques there is no placental transfer. The integrase inhibitor\\n raltegravir (FDA category C) passes the placenta (Jaworsky 2010, McKeown 2010,\\nBelissa 2015). Raltegravir and dolutegravir have a prolonged elimination half-life in\\n(premature) neonates (Pain 2015). \\nFDA pregnancy classification for drugs \\nFDA has classified the potential toxicity during pregnancy into categories A-D. All\\nHIV agents belong in categories B-D, since “harmlessness through studies on the\\nhuman being” (category A) has not been shown for any HIV drug.\\nFDA category B is defined as “Animal studies have revealed no evidence of harm to\\nthe fetus; however, there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant\\nwomen”. FDA category B includes ddI, FTC, tenofovir (TDF), etravirine, nevirapine,\\nrilpivirine, atazanavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, T-20 and maraviroc, dolute-\\ngravir and elvitegravir/cobicistat/TDF/FTC.\\nFDA category C is defined as “Animal studies have shown an adverse effect and\\nthere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Use in preg-\\nnancy should occur only after careful benefit/risk appraisal.” All drugs not men-\\ntioned in category B fall into the FDA category C. \\nFDA category D is defined as “Adequate well-controlled or observational studies in\\npregnant women have demonstrated a risk for the fetus. Nevertheless, the benefits\\nof therapy may outweigh the potential risk.” For example, the drug may be accept-\\nable if it is needed in a life-threatening situation or serious disease for which safer\\ndrugs cannot be used or are ineffective. Efavirenz falls into category D because of\\nneural tube defects in humans after first trimester exposure.\\nFDA category X is defined as “Studies in animals or humans have demonstrated\\nfetal abnormalities and/or there is a positive evidence of human fetal risk based on\\nadverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience, and the risk\\ninvolved in use of the drug in pregnant women clearly outweigh potential benefits.” \\nPrevention of perinatal HIV infection\\nIn approximately 75% of cases, HIV is transmitted prior to, or during the last weeks\\nprior to birth. About 10% of vertical infections occur before the third trimester, and\\n10–15% are caused by breastfeeding.\\nThe probability of HIV transmission to a neonate correlates with the viral load\\n(Warszawski 2008). This also applies to women receiving ART (Table 3). If the viral\\nload is undetectable using currently available tests, the probability of transmission\\nis extremely low (Tubiana 2011). Likewise, premature births and premature rupture\\nof membranes are associated with an increased transmission risk, in particular when\\nHIV suppression is insufficient.\\n536 Women and Children'),\n",

In the case of efficient ART with fixed combinations, it is feasible to\\n continue and not replace any of the NRTIs with AZT (Tariq 2011, CDC 2014).\\nProcedure in cases of additional pregnancy risks\\nSeveral risks (Table 5) require an intensified prophylaxis. Here too, the risk of trans-\\nmission drops in the case of sufficient ART. In premature births, for example,  perinatal\\nHIV transmission only occurred when the mother had received no prophylaxis or\\nonly AZT monoprophylaxis (Aagaard-Tillery 2006).\\nIntrapartum prophylaxis without antepartum regimens\\nIf the diagnosis of HIV infection is only established at the time of delivery, mother\\nand newborn receive a dual or triple combination prophylaxis with AZT (plus 3TC\\nand/or nevirapine) in cases of highly increased risk (high viral load and/or medical\\ncomplications during delivery). Due to rapid resistance, nevirapine should only be\\nadministered in combination with other drugs.\\nTreatment during delivery\\nElective cesarean section or vaginal delivery in cases of uncomplicated course\\nof pregnancy \\nCesarean section is carried out swiftly by experienced obstetricians prior to the onset\\nof labor at the earliest from 37+0 up to 37+6 weeks of gestation using the Misgav-\\nLadach technique, which reduces bleeding. Blunt preparation and the delivery of\\nthe child within the intact amniotic sac are considered ideal (Schäfer 2001). In the\\ncase of undetectable viral load along with long-term ART, the advantage of elective\\ncesarean over vaginal delivery is no longer recommended. For this reason, it is becom-\\ning more common in many countries to dispense with a C-section in favor of a later\\nvaginal delivery (Townsend 2014).\\nHigh-risk pregnancy\\nCesarean section in cases of multi-gravidity should be carried out using the same\\ntechnique as for a cesarean section in a single pregnancy. In this context, the skill\\nand experience of the operating surgeon are especially important. Cesarean sections\\nin cases of premature infants are also important to avoid hypoxia in the neonate;\\nthe special aspects of chemoprophylaxis have been described above.\\nIn cases with a premature rupture of membranes of less than four hours duration, a\\nsection is expedient for prophylactic reasons, providing that the clinical situation at\\nthat stage of delivery still allows this. If the rupture of membranes has lasted more\\nthan four hours, there is no longer an advantage of cesarean section compared to\\nvaginal delivery. Nevertheless, vaginal delivery should occur as swiftly as possible,\\nsince the HIV transmission risk increases by about 2% per hour. The extension of\\nthe prophylactic scheme (Tables 5 and 6) is important if viral load in a high HIV\\ntransmission risk is not under 50 copies/ml at the time of delivery or 12 weeks before\\ndelivery has not yet been under 50 copies/ml. On the other hand in pregnancies\\nwith an increased transmission risk with a viral load of <50 copies/ml at least 12\\nweeks before delivery a mono-prophylaxis with AZT for 2–4 weeks is sufficient for\\nthe newborn.\\n538 Women and Children'),\n",

Nevirapine\\nis given either once to the mother before delivery and once to the infant, or twice\\npostnatally. If maternal nevirapine administration occurs less than an hour before\\ndelivery, then the newborn receives its first dose within the first 48 hours (Stringer\\n2003). If nevirapine was a part of the combination therapy for the mother, the dose\\nis doubled to 4 mg/kg in newborns because of possible enzyme induction. In addi-\\ntion, newborns receive an AZT+3TC prophylaxis for six weeks (CDC 2014). \\nThe pharmacokinetic data on ART in neonates are, however, extremely limited.\\nAccording to the CDC guidelines (2014) the prenatal nevirapine dose to the mother\\nis not applicable.

In addition, to lower\\ntoxicity only AZT is recommended as post-exposition prophylaxis for six weeks \\n(two-drug regime, CDC 2014). In neonates whose mothers did not receive ART,\\n prophylaxis with a two- or three drug regimen is superior to zidovudine alone\\n(Nielsen Saines 2012).

HIV and Wanting to be a Parent\\nULRIKE SONNENBERG-SCHWAN, MICHAEL WEIGEL\\nIntroduction\\nFor a growing number of men and women living with HIV/AIDS the perspective of\\nparenthood is an important part in their planning of the future. Procreation without\\nrisk, or at very low risk of infection for the uninfected partner or prospective child,\\nis achievable for couples in which one or both partners are HIV-infected. In an increa-\\nsing number of countries reproductive counselling and/or support is provided to\\ncouples affected by HIV. \\nProcreative options for HIV-affected couples vary from unprotected intercourse to\\nseveral techniques of assisted reproduction, donor insemination or adoption. In view\\nof the strongly decreased risk of transmission with undetectable viral load, concep-\\ntion via intercourse without condoms has increasingly become an option under\\ncertain circumstances.\\nThis has been greatly influenced by the “EKAF Statement” (Vernazza 2008, see also\\nART chapter) regarding the unlikeliness of HIV transmission while on effective ART.\\nIn January 2008, the EKAF (Swiss Commission on AIDS-related issues) stated that\\nphysicians could inform their patients about a negligible sexual transmission risk if\\nthree conditions are met:\\n\\x81 The HIV-infected patient is on a physician-monitored ART and is adherent \\n\\x81 Plasma viral load has consistently been undetectable for more than 6 months \\n\\x81 No sexually transmitted diseases are present in either of the partners\\nThe statement also emphasized that only the HIV-negative partners can decide for\\nthemselves whether they want to stop using condoms with their seropositive partner.\\nThe background of the statement includes some longitudinal studies on serodiscor-\\ndant couples. No infection occurred when the partners were on ART or the viral load\\nin untreated partners was below 1,000 copies/ml (see chapter on Prevention). A\\n retrospective Spanish study (Barreiro 2006) saw no infections in 74 HIV discordant\\ncouples (76 pregnancies) who conceived via timed intercourse. All HIV+ partners\\nhad a viral load below detection. However, data from couples who did not conceive\\nwere not available. This option was discussed prior to the Swiss Statement (Barreiro\\n2007). With a view to reproductive aspects the Swiss Statement puts on record that\\ninsemination with processed sperm is no longer indicated for prevention of HIV\\ntransmission if the viral load is below detection. \\nStudies on the association between viral load in sperm and blood show a high\\n correlation, but data are limited (Kalichman 2008). Viral load in semen or genital\\nsecretions does not always correlate with plasma viral load (Pasquier 2009). HIV can\\nsometimes be detected in semen or genital secretions even when viral load in blood\\nplasma is undetectable. Since the publication of the HPTN 052 Study (Cohen 2011)\\nshowing a 96% reduction of HIV transmission with immediate use of ART, a growing\\nnumber of studies has added support to the Swiss statement (Loutfy 2013).\\nThe British fertility guidelines recommend to advise on the negligible risk of trans-\\nmission to the female partner through unprotected sexual intercourse when the EKAF\\ncriteria are met for the HIV+ male partner (National Collaborating Centre for\\nWomen’s and Children’s Health 2012). The French guidelines consider natural con-\\nception as a reasonable option for serodiscordant couples with no detectable viral\\nload, recommending self-insemination (when the woman is HIV+) or timed unpro-\\ntected intercourse (when the man is HIV+) as the safest option (Mandelbrot 2012).\\nThe US guidelines (NIH 2014) recommend self-insemination or sperm preparation\\n547'),\n",

HIV+ partners are advised to start ART before starting conception proce-\\ndures. For couples with no access to reproductive services natural conception at ovu-\\nlation is see as a choice, when the infected partner has no detectable viral load. Pre-\\nexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is seen as an additional option.\\nIn view of the increasing worldwide access to ART, natural conception is increasingly\\ndiscussed as a safe option for couples even in resource limited regions (Ong’ech 2012).\\nFor HIV+ women with an uninfected partner, self-insemination is a safe and afford-\\nable procedure also in these countries (Mmeje 2012).\\nNatural conception now has become an important issue for many HIV-discordant\\ncouples seeking reproductive counselling. The EKAF Statement and current data and\\nthe resulting reproductive options should be discussed. Usually, there are significant\\ndifferences in individual risk  estimation and the need for safety. In any case, couples\\nwho want to exclude even a minimal risk or who are facing fertility disorders are\\nthose who seek counselling. Furthermore it has to be considered that in some seropos-\\nitive  partners the viral load is not effectively suppressed or that they have not started\\ntreatment. In these cases insemination with processed sperm – in case of unimpaired\\nfertility – can be the method of choice. The start of ART in patients with low viral\\nload in order to open the option for natural conception also is an option. \\nThe German-Austrian guidelines for diagnostics and treatment of HIV-affected\\ncouples (DAIG 2011) suggest the following options:\\nFertile HIV-discordant couples, ART, viral load below detectability, no other STIs: \\n\\x81 Intercourse without condom during ovulation\\n\\x81 Intercourse without condom plus PrEP\\n\\x81 Self insemination in case of infection of the female partner\\n\\x81 Intrauterine insemination and sperm processing in case of infection of the male partner\\nHIV-discordant couples, fertility impaired, detectable viral load or no ART: \\n\\x81 Depending on medical indication, several methods of assisted reproduction. In case\\nHIV+ male partner sperm processing and cryopreservation are advised. \\nFertile HIV-concordant couples, undetectable viral load: \\n\\x81 Intercourse without condom\\n\\x81 HIV-concordant couples, fertility impaired, detectable viral load or no ART:\\nDepending on medical indication, several methods of assisted reproduction \\nDonor insemination is an alternative safe option for a small number of couples, but\\ndue to legal restrictions it is only offered in a minority of centers. In the UK, for\\nexample, there are no restrictions on donor insemination, whereas in Germany access\\nis limited. In addition, most couples wish for a child that is the biological offspring\\nof both parents. Adoption often is only a theoretical option: HIV infection of a\\npartner often renders this procedure very difficult or even impossible (e.g., in\\nGermany). Egg cell donation might be an option for a small number of women facing\\nsevere fertility disorders, but is offered only in some countries (i.e., Spain).\\nPre-conception counselling\\nThe counseling of the couple should not only consider extensive information on all\\nreproductive options, but also the psychosocial situation, the importance of a\\nnetwork of social support from family or friends, and planning and perspectives\\nabout the future as a family (Nakhuda 2005). A supporting, empathic and accepting\\nmode of counselling is advisable, as couples can feel distressed if their motives for,\\nor entitlement to, parenthood are questioned.

According to the German recommendations, the\\nchoice of method depends on the results of gynecological and andrological investi-\\ngations and the couple’s preference. The success rate using IUI has been shown to\\nbe reduced if the sperm is washed and then cryopreserved before use. This is neces-\\nsary in some centers where PCR testing of the washed sample for HIV cannot be\\ndone on the day of insemination.

Following recent studies, this risk seems to be only theoretical. \\n\\x81 During treatment, consistent condom use is important, especially when the part-\\nner’s viral load is not effectively suppressed.

These depend on the technique applied and range from about € 500 to \\n€ 5,000 per cycle. In some countries, couples have cost-free access to treatment. \\n\\x81 Even the most sophisticated techniques cannot guarantee successful treatment.\\nFollowing successful reproductive treatment, couples are usually monitored for HIV\\nstatus for 6-12 months after childbirth, depending on the center.\\nThe safety of sperm washing\\nThe technique of processing sperm from HIV+ men prior to the insemination of their\\nnegative partners was first published by Semprini in 1992. The first inseminations\\nwith sperm washed free of HIV were carried out in Italy and Germany as early as\\n1989 and 1991, respectively. Up to mid-2003, more than 1,800 couples had been\\ntreated in about 4,500 cycles, applying various techniques of assisted reproduction.\\nMore than 500 children have been born with no seroconversion reported in the\\ncenters closely following the protocol of washing and testing the sperm prior to\\nassisted reproductive techniques (Bujan 2007).\\nNative ejaculate mainly consists of three fractions: spermatozoa, seminal plasma and\\nnuclear concomitant cells. The HIV progenome and virus have so far been detected\\nin the seminal plasma, the concomitant cells, and occasionally in immobile sper-\\nmatozoa. Several studies have indicated that viable, motile spermatozoa are not likely\\nto be a target for HIV infection (Pena 2003, Gilling-Smith 2003).\\nMotile spermatozoa can be isolated by standardized preparation techniques. After\\nseparation of the spermatozoa from plasma fractions and NSC (non-spermatozoa\\ncells), the spermatozoa are washed twice with culture medium and re-suspended in\\nfresh culture medium. Incubation for 20–60 minutes allows motile sperm to “swim\\nup” to the supernatant. To be more certain that it is not contaminated with viral\\nparticles, an aliquot of the sample should be tested for HIV nucleic acid using highly\\nsensitive detection methods (Weigel 2001, Gilling-Smith 2003, Pasquier 2006).\\nDepending on the method, the limit of detection is 10 copies/ml. After having studied\\nthe effectiveness of several methods of sperm processing, Anderson (2005) concluded\\nthat the combination of gradient density centrifugation and swim-up allows a\\n10,000-fold decrease of HIV-1 concentration in sperm. Since HIV could theoretically\\nremain undetected, sperm washing is currently regarded as a very effective risk reduc-\\ntion, although not risk-free.\\nMost of the European centers that offer assisted reproduction to HIV-discordant\\ncouples are part of the CREATHE network, which aims to optimize treatment and\\nsafety of the methods as well as to compile an extensive database. Compiled data\\nfrom several centers hint on the safety and reliability of sperm washing (Bujan 2007).\\nPre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)\\nEven before the FDA approval of Truvada ® as the first antiretroviral agent for the\\n prevention of HIV transmission through sexual intercourse, PrEP before periovula-\\ntory unprotected intercourse was an option for serodiscordant couples in some coun-\\ntries. Couples abstain from condom use only during the woman’s fertile days.\\n550 Women and Children'),\n",

Data from\\nSwitzerland and Germany shows high acceptance in couples. No case of HIV trans-\\nmission has been reported in 53 couples, the pregnancy rate was 75% (Vernazza\\n2011). A growing number of studies shows the feasibility of this approach, especially\\nin resource-limited settings (Adenji 2013, Whetham 2013). The fertility of HIV-neg-\\native men does not seem to be impaired by taking PrEP (Were 2014).

The transmission risk might be further reduced when the intercourse without\\ncondoms is limited to the time of ovulation. Women should be advised on the impor-\\ntance of adherence and regular checks of the viral load (Fakoya 2008).\\nIf a woman is not taking ART, the viral load is not successfully suppressed, or  concerns\\nabout the remaining risk are strong, self-insemination may be the method of choice.\\nIn some cases, ovarian stimulation may be advisable. This, however, requires highly\\nqualified supervision to avoid multiple gestations.\\nIt is important to time ovulation accurately (i.e., by use of computer-based ovula-\\ntion kits or urine sticks). A simple inexpensive way of determining whether the cycles\\nare ovulatory, helpful in women who have regular cycles, is a basal temperature chart\\nbeginning about three months before the first self-insemination.\\nAt the time of ovulation, couples can either have protected intercourse with a sper-\\nmicide-free condom and introduce the ejaculate into the vaginal cavity afterwards,\\nor the ejaculate can be vaginally injected using a syringe or applied with a diaphragm\\nor portio cap. Thus the conception remains within the private sphere of the couple.\\nAfter 6–12 months of unsuccessful self-insemination, the couple should have further\\nfertility investigations with a view to assisted conception. Should the couple\\n experience problems with self-insemination, intrauterine insemination (IUI) can be\\nconsidered. HIV-specific and infective diagnostics are recommended. If no pregnancy\\nhas occurred over a period of 6–12 months (or earlier, if the couple so wishes)  fertility\\ndiagnostics should be carried out (Table 1). If there are indicators of reduced fertil-\\nity in one or both partners, fertility diagnostics might be carried out at an earlier\\nstage in the counselling process.\\nFertility disorders\\nIn some cases, women will only be able to conceive by intercourse without condom\\nor self insemination. Dependent on the fertility status of both partners, IVF and ICSI\\ncan be considered as methods of choice.\\nFertility disorders in HIV+ women seem to have a higher prevalence than in an age-\\nmatched negative population (Ohl 2005, Gingelmaier 2010) and might lead to a\\nHIV and Wanting to be a Parent    551'),\n",

Antiretroviral Therapy in Children \\nTIM NIEHUES \\nCharacteristics of HIV infection in childhood\\nIn 2014, the UNAIDS report estimated that worldwide 2.6 million children are living\\nwith HIV while another 150,000 died from it (http://www.unaids.org/). \\nChildren are usually infected through perinatal transmission (vertical infection). In\\nmost cases (75–90%) HIV is transmitted peri- or intrapartum. Only a small propor-\\ntion of children are infected in utero(10–25%). Transmission by breastfeeding is more\\ncommon in resource-limited settings, but plays a minor role in developed countries,\\nwhere breastfeeding by HIV+ mothers is strongly discouraged. The increasing knowl-\\nedge about how HIV is vertically transmitted has led to highly effective interven-\\ntions to prevent transmission and a significant reduction of the transmission rate to\\nless than 2%. New infections in HIV-exposed children still occur\\n\\x81 if the HIV status of the mother is unknown\\n\\x81 if transmission prophylaxis is incomplete\\n\\x81 if the mother does not have access to transmission prophylaxis during pregnancy.\\nWithout ART there is a rapid progression of the HIV infection with AIDS-defining\\nsymptoms and potentially lethal complications in a significant percentage of infants\\n(10–25%). In the remaining children there is a much slower disease course with a\\nmean duration of more than 8 years until AIDS-defining symptoms occur. The reason\\nfor this bimodal disease course is unclear, but the high mortality in infants (<1 year\\nof age) has influenced the ART guidelines which strongly recommend to aggressively\\ntreat all HIV+ infants once they are diagnosed.\\nViral dynamics in children are significantly different from the rapid increase and\\ndecrease of viral load seen in untreated adults within a few months of acute HIV\\ninfection. This reflects both the rapid somatic growth of the lymphatic system favor-\\ning viral spread and a less effective anti-HIV immunity in children as compared to\\nadults (Figure 1).\\n556\\nFigure 1: Differences in the natural course of HIV in the first months after infection/transmission of\\nviral load and HIV immunity between adults and infants/toddlers'),\n",

Lymphocyte counts are very\\nhigh in infancy and decline to adult levels after the age of 6 (Table 1).\\nIn adults typical manifestations of the acute HIV seroconversion illness include fever,\\nsore throat, lymphadenopathy and a mononucleosis-like disease. HIV seroconver-\\nsion illness has not been described in perinatally-infected children. Symptomatic\\ndisease presenting in childhood has been classified according to severity of symp-\\ntoms (Table 2) (http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/guidelines/art/en/).\\nIf antiretroviral therapy in children is effective, opportunistic infections (OIs) become\\na rarity. However, in children who newly present with HIV (e.g., if HIV status in the\\nmother is unknown and there was no transmission prophylaxis) opportunistic infec-\\ntions are observed and quickly put the infant at risk.\\nDiagnosis of HIV infection in children\\nA direct method of detecting HIV is necessary: the identification of HIV by RNA or\\nDNA PCR is highly sensitive and specific. High titers of IgG are transferred transpla-\\ncentally from mother to child. Maternal antibodies can be detected in children up\\nto the age of 18 months or even longer. Thus, in infants, the detection of HIV anti-\\nbodies does not prove infection. \\nCord blood is not useful for diagnosis because it contains maternal cells which cause\\na false positive PCR test result. Within the first 48 hours after birth, 62% of all infected\\ninfants are still HIV PCR negative. Even 4 weeks after birth, 11% of the infections are\\nstill not detectable by PCR (Dunn 1995, Burgard 2012). PCR tests become reliable\\nonly after about 3 weeks after birth. Once a positive HIV PCR is found, a second\\nindependent blood sample should be taken as soon as possible. As diverse subtypes\\nexist, it is advised to test paired samples from mother and infant by HIV PCR. If in doubt,\\nexpert advice should be sought but initiation of ART should not unduly be delayed.\\nThe disappearance of maternal IgG antibodies to HIV needs to be documented before\\nHIV infection can be definitely excluded in the child. Tests with an increased sensi-\\ntivity to detect HIV antibodies are not useful as they may detect maternal antibod-\\nies up to 28 months of age leading to anxiety and confusion in the affected families\\n(Nastouli 2007). In the absence of breast-feeding two separate negative HIV PCRs (at\\nleast 2 weeks after cessation of post-exposure prophylaxis) are required to confirm\\nthat the child is not infected. Always keep in mind that babies can get infected after\\ninitially negative tests, if they are breast-fed (which the doctor may be unaware of).\\nA negative HIV test in the mother early in pregnancy should not preclude testing\\nthe child, as the rate of mother to child transmission is high if the mother becomes\\ninfected later in pregnancy or during breastfeeding. In children older than \\n18 months, HIV infection is diagnosed in an analogous way to adults (see chapter\\non HIV Testing).\\nAntiretroviral Therapy in Children    557'),\n",

Successful treatment\\nrequires an interdisciplinary approach with the children and their families.\\nGood adherence is key to treatment success. Education of the child and the family\\nregarding antiretroviral drugs is necessary. Sometimes a brief period of supervision\\nin the hospital at the start of ART is useful to educate the child and family and gauge\\nthe tolerability of the regimen. In the prospective PACTG 377 study, adherence was\\ndefined as having not missed a single medication dose over the previous 3 days.\\nAccording to this definition, only 70% of 125 children were found to be adherent\\nwithin an observation period of 48 weeks (Van Dyke 2002). The modalities of the\\ndaily intake of medication need to be discussed in detail and adjusted to the daily\\nand weekly routines of the family. Adherence is particularly problematic in adoles-\\ncence, and successful reduction or control of viral load may only be achieved in a\\nthird of these patients (Ding 2009). In this age group, adherence often needs close\\nfollow-up including other health care professionals such as psychologists and social\\nworkers. In a meta-analysis, peer support and home-based nursing were shown to\\nimprove ART adherence (Bain-Brickley 2011). Sometimes (planned) periods off ART,\\ndespite the theoretical risk of clinical progression, have to be accepted in this group\\nof patients. The BREATHER trial by the PENTA group in HIV+ adolescents (in whom\\nvirus was very well controlled) compared a 5-day short cycle to regular 7-day treat-\\nment. In this small study a short-cycle treatment was safe (www.ctu.mrc.ac.uk/\\nour_research/research_areas/hiv/studies/breather/). Another promising approach to\\nincreasing adherence in children and adolescents is the use of once-daily regimens\\n(e.g., the future PENTA 20 trial). \\nUnderdosing by the doctor has been shown to be a problem in daily practice (Menson\\n2006). Dosing by weight instead of body surface area (given as an alternative in some\\nolder guidelines) may result in underdosing and ongoing growth may not be adjusted\\nfor. Particular genotypes are associated with hypermetabolism of NNRTIs and PIs.\\n560 Women and Children\\nFigure 2: Interdisciplinary care for children and families who are affected by HIV'),\n",

Still, pretreatment resistance genotyping should be done.\\nClasses of antiretrovirals\\nDrugs of all antiretroviral classes can lead to nausea, vomiting, fever, headache, diar-\\nrhea, liver dysfunction, rash (sometimes severe) and anorexia. There is significant\\nhyperlipidemia in a number of children and its long term consequences are unknown\\n(Jacobson 2011). Some investigators found subclinical artherosclerosis and a high\\nrate of coronary artery abnormalities in adolescents and young adults with long term\\nART exposure (Mikhail 2011). As with adults, dyslipidemia is associated with the use\\nof PIs (Lainka 2002). This includes elevated total cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), and\\nlow-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and decreases in high density lipopro-\\ntein cholesterol (HDL-c). In lipodystrophy, there is a loss of subcutaneous fat\\n (lipoatrophy) and/or a deposition of fat tissue subcutaneously or in visceral stores\\n(lipohypertrophy). There are no clear diagnostic criteria. Studies from South Africa,\\nTanzania and Uganda estimate prevalence on ART as between 8–30% (Piloya 2012,\\nArpadi 2013, Kinabo 2013). Lipodystrophy and dyslipidemia coexist, and their inter-\\nconnection is unclear. Other classes such as NRTIs (e.g., d4T) and NNRTIs (efavirenz,\\nnot nevirapine) also play a role in the pathogenesis of lipodystrophy.\\nInsulin resistance is another side effect that may present with or without fasting\\nhyperglycemia, with new onset diabetes mellitus and exacerbations of pre-existing\\ndiabetes (Bitnun 2005). Moreover, PIs may influence bone mineral density and\\nmetabolism (Mora 2004). Taken together, the long-term consequences of PI-con-\\ntaining ART for growth and development of the child are currently not known. In\\nthe Swiss cohort, children exposed to PIs over a period of more than 10 years did\\nnot experience any major side effects (Rudin 2008).\\nNRTIs\\nThe combination of 2 NRTIs as part of ART is effective and well-tolerated. For older\\nchildren there are fixed dose combinations (see below). Severe side effects are rare\\nbut potentially life-threatening, such as lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis.\\nNeuromuscular dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, pancytopenia, pancreatitis and neu-\\nropathy are probably related to mitochondrial toxicity caused by NRTIs. On a labo-\\nratory level, mitochondrial toxicity is also seen in HIV+ pregnant women and their\\ninfants. Although it is uncertain whether this altered intrauterine metabolic pro-\\ngramming poses a risk for their future health . Due to pharmacologic and antiviral\\nantagonism as well as synergistic neurotoxicity, the following combinations are not\\nrecommended: AZT+d4T, ddI+TDF and FTC+3TC. The prevalence of lipoatrophy in\\nchildren is unknown, as diagnostic criteria are not established.

In adults, few\\nrandomized and prospective trials have shown that a change of antiretroviral therapy\\nguided by resistance tests may lead to better treatment response. Usually, the initial\\ntreatment regimen contains a double NRTI backbone (e.g., AZT+3TC or ABC+3TC).\\nWhen changing therapy, it appears useful to introduce a backbone with two new\\nNRTIs plus a new class, e.g., INSTIs may be a good option for introducing a new\\nclass.\\nSupportive therapy and prophylaxis\\nOIs have become rare in perinatally infected children who experience immune recon-\\nstitution with ART. In most of these children respiratory and other infections are not\\nmuch more common than in healthy children. The incidence of invasive\\n pneumococcal disease among perinatally HIV+ children has decreased since the\\nintroduction of ART (Steenhoff 2008). Children who are treated with ART and who\\nare clinically stable can even be given live varicella virus vaccine and show a spe-\\ncific response, which is an impressive sign of successful immune reconstitution\\n(Taweesith 2011). In the vast majority of stable treated children treatment with intra-\\nvenous immunoglobulins and PCP prophylaxis is no longer required (Nachman\\n2005). However, there are still life-threatening infections and deaths from HIV if\\nperinatal HIV infection is unrecognized or ART has not led to immune reconstitu-\\ntion. A description of such infections in adults is given in other chapters of this book.\\nAn excellent and detailed guide for treatment of children with OIs can be found at\\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5811a1.htm.\\nConclusion\\nIn many aspects HIV infection in children is different from HIV infection in adults.\\nThe ongoing growth and development of children, their viral dynamics and imma-\\nturity of the immune system result in a different response to HIV compared to adults.\\nThis has important consequences for the diagnosis and treatment of HIV in chil-\\ndren. The aim of therapy is to achieve maximum efficacy while avoiding long-term\\nside effects. Sustained success in the treatment of children with HIV infection\\ndepends on:\\n\\x81 a multidisciplinary approach;\\n\\x81 standardized treatment protocols;\\n\\x81 participation in multicenter trials;\\n\\x81 appropriate formulations and treatment strategies for children & introduction of\\nnew classes of ART (e.g., INSTIs).\\nIn developed countries the clinical picture of HIV infection in children has now\\nchanged from an often fatal to a treatable chronic infection, allowing children to\\nlead a largely normal life. This picture is still different in developing countries but\\nprevention of mother-to-child transmission and broader coverage with ART is getting\\nbetter and the number of deaths from HIV infection in children estimated by UNAIDS\\nis decreasing (2006: 380,000; 2014: 150,000). \\n568 Women and Children'),\n",

HIV and Renal Function\\nANSGAR RIEKE\\nDue to HIV+ patients’ increasing age and comorbidities, kidney diseases will also be\\non the rise. Diabetes and arterial hypertension raise the risk of renal insufficiency\\nby tenfold and account for 71% of dialysis cases in the US (Winston 2008). According\\nto cohort studies, the prevalence of diabetes in male HIV+ patients is 12%, which is\\nfour times as common as in the age-based normal population (Winston 2008). The\\nincrease in renal insufficiency in the elderly is more pronounced (Goulet 2007). Renal\\ninsufficiency and the extent of proteinuria are also independent predictive factors\\nfor mortality in HIV+ patients, while half of all patients die of cardiovascular disease\\n(USRDS 2010).\\nIncreased creatinine is an indicator for kidney disease, the internationally valid\\n classification of renal insufficiency follows the GFR (glomerular filtration rate) (given\\nin ml/min/1.73 m\\n2):\\nStage I Kidney damage, normal or increased GFR >90 \\nStage II Kidney damage and slightly reduced GFR 60 – 89 \\nStage III Moderate reduction in GFR 30 – 59 \\nStage IV Severe restriction of GFR 15 – 29 \\nStage V Kidney failure <15 \\nNephroprotection\\nAcute renal failure is twice as common overall as in the non-infected, and the adjusted\\nmortality rate is also significantly higher (Wyatt 2006). Despite the use of ART, the\\nincidence of dialysis treatment in HIV+ patients remains unchanged. In the US,\\n particularly Afro-Americans are affected, in whom the risk of kidney failure is tenfold\\nhigher than that of non-infected persons (Lucas 2007). \\nThe following principles should be followed for nephroprotection – give up nico-\\ntine, keep blood pressure below 140/80 mm Hg (or <130/80 mmHg in the case of\\nproteinuria) and provide for prevention or treatment of diabetes mellitus or other\\nmetabolic syndromes. The HIV-related changes in the glomerulum and the tubular\\nsystem are a good reason to begin and continue ART. This has also been reflected in\\nthe international therapy guidelines in which kidney involvement is another reason\\nfor beginning ART (Choi 2009).\\nClinical manifestation/diagnosis of nephropathy\\nThe clinical picture of renal damage is often unspecific, with tiredness, poor con-\\ncentration, loss of appetite, high blood pressure and possibly new edemas. Based on\\nthe cause of the kidney disease, one can differentiate between pre-renal, intra-renal\\n(glomerular, tubular, interstitial) and postrenal. A sonography quickly supplies infor-\\nmation about a post-renal drainage impediment (renal retention, prostate hyper-\\ntrophy?) as well as about the size of the kidney (reduced with a narrow parenchyma\\nin the case of chronic renal insufficiency). The anamnesis provides an indication for\\na pre-natal cause (NSAR, infections, sepsis, contrast agent?) The diagnosis is supple-\\nmented by a urine screening test or sediment and the determination of creatinine,\\nelectrolytes (K, Na, Ca) and phosphate. Several factors such the extent and severity\\nof anemia, metabolic acidosis (blood-gas analysis), dysfunction of the calcium-phos-\\nphate, metabolism, possible venal thrombosis and newly diagnosed arterial hyper-\\ntension are associated with the duration of the kidney disease. They can help to\\n differentiate between acute and chronic renal failure.\\n572'),\n",

In the US, HIV-AN is the third most\\ncommon reason for dialysis in African-Americans aged 20-64 years (Winston 2008).\\nThe genetic predisposition probably results from the reciprocity of the human gene\\nMYH9 (nonmuscle myosin heavy chain 9) with HIV and a neighboring apolipopro-\\ntein L1 gene as promoter of HIV-AN. As mutations of the ApoL-1 gene led to an\\n evolutionary advantage in coping with sleeping sickness, HIV-AN is found almost\\nexclusively in people of black African origin (Soleiman 2011, Kopp 2008, Kao 2008).\\nDespite hemodialysis, the one-year survival rate arrives at approximately 50%; ART\\nhas reduced the dialysis risk through HIV-AN by 40%. In addition, the one-year\\n survival rate on dialysis has increased from 25 to 75% thanks to ART (Winston 2008).\\nMost patients have a poor immune status with <100 CD4 T cells/µl (only 20% are\\nin the normal range).

The use of steroids is controversial (1 mg/kg/day for 2 to 11 weeks), but is\\nfavored in the US alongside starting ART, particularly in cases with a course similar\\nto lupus (Haas 2005, Gupta 2005, Choi 2009). \\nThe question of whether a case of HIV-AN needs to be confirmed by means of a\\nkidney biopsy is the subject of discussion. Should the ethnicity suggest such a diag-\\nnosis, ART should be started immediately. Over an observation period of 3 months,\\nviral load should be completely suppressed, the blood pressure well adjusted, if\\n necessary diabetes treated and the therapy supplemented with a lipid therapy (e.g.,\\npravastatin along the lines of cardiological recommendations following infarction)\\n(Szczech 2009). It is often the case that renal function improves and proteinuria\\nlowers with this therapy. The decision to perform a biopsy should be placed in the\\nhands of a nephrologist, depending on the extent of proteinuria and restriction of\\nGFR (<60 ml/min/1.73 m\\n2). Thanks to triple diagnostics made up of light and elec-\\ntron microscopy together with immunohistochemistry, kidney puncture can clarify\\nthe many causes of kidney damage and their prognosis.\\nOther cases of post-infectious glomerulonephritis \\nIn caucasian patients, IgA nephropathy, membranous and membranoproliferative\\nGN must all be regarded as typical results of HIV infection. At 6–32%, non-black\\nAfrican HIV+ patients show a considerably higher prevalence of proteinuria than\\nnon-infected persons (Soleiman 2011). Furthermore, many pathogens are able to\\ntrigger or support a post-infectious or other chronic GN. Viral infections such as\\nCMV , EBV , HZV , influenza, adenovirus, hantavirus or parvovirus B19 do this as well\\nas HIV. After malaria, syphilis and infections with staphylococci, pneumococci,\\nlegionella, salmonella and other infectious agents, an acute post-infectious glomeru-\\nlonephritis can also occur. In addition, there is a risk of circulatory renal failure in\\nthe case of profuse diarrhea in the context of an infectious bowel disorder.\\nIn the case of membranous glomerulonephritis, malignant tumors and hepatitis (B\\nand C) must be ruled out as a classical “secondary GN”. Chronic hepatitis C can lead\\nto a membranoproliferative GN, or through cryoglobulinemia cause vasculitis with\\nrenal involvement.\\nThe most common form of renal disease in Germany is IgA nephropathy, which can\\nalso be triggered by HIV , respiratory infections or infection with hepatitis.

In the proximal tubulus, the\\ntransporter OCT2 leads to an intake of creatinine from the the blood in the tubular\\ncell, which in turn is secreted into the urine via MATE 1. The integrase inhibitor\\ndolutegravir inhibits OCT2, whereas the pharmacoenhancer cobicistat inhibits MATE\\n1. Thus, both substances block the alternative secretion route via the tubular cells,\\nwhich leads to a slight increase in creatinine (0.14 mg/dl) or a drop in estimated\\neGFR of around 15 ml. Of course, this does not change the true GFR and therefore\\nhas no effect on the glomerulus or the renal function. Tivicay\\n® can thus also be used\\nin patients with limited kidney function. However, care must be taken regarding the\\ncombination with TDF, as it may be difficult to identify a true impairment of renal\\nfunction, and TDF must be reduced in cases of a GFR of less than 60 ml. The fixed-\\ndose combination Stribild\\n® should thus only be used in patients with an eGFR \\n>90 ml and should be avoided below 70 ml.\\nTenofovir itself is absorbed into the tubular cell not only via glomerular filtration\\nbut also via the transporter OAT 1 and is then secreted actively (dependent on ATP)\\nvia MRP 2 and 4 into the urine of the proximal tubulus. Should true filtration in the\\nglomerulus decline (for example, in cases of acute kidney failure), attempts are made\\nto eliminate more TDF via the tubular cell (increased activity of OAT 1). This results\\nin an increased concentration of TDF in the tubular cell, which in turn leads via a\\ndisruption of the mitochondrial polymerase gamma to a decline in energy-depen-\\ndent MRP 2 and 4 transport capacity and can thus end in tubular damage (Perazella\\n2010). Indeed, concentration-dependent damage caused by TDF to the tubular cell\\ncan be demonstrated: patients with low body weight are more vulnerable (Nishijirna\\n2012).\\nWhen the agents filtered from the glomerulus in primary urine exceed the transport\\ncapacity of the reabsorbing tubular cells they are excreted with the urine. The most\\nprominent example is the glucose threshold of the kidneys (180 mg/dl). However, a\\ntransport dysfunction in the tubular system can also be caused by drugs such as\\n cidofovir, tenofovir and adefovir. This is known as secondary (drug-induced)\\nFanconi’s syndrome and is distinguished by a malfunction of the tubular system\\nwithout there necessarily being any impairment of the GFR. There is an increased\\namount of phosphate, amino acids and glucose in the urine, whereas phosphate in\\nthe blood is reduced. The loss of amino acids, phosphate, glucose, bicarbonate and\\nother organic and inorganic substances, as well as water, can become clinically\\n manifest in the form of increased urination, thirst, tiredness, bone pain or weakness,\\nand lead to secondary changes in the bone metabolism.\\nNot every hypophosphatemia (<0.8 mmol/l) is Fanconi’s syndrome.

At\\na serum phosphate level <0.48 mmol/l (1.5 mg/dl) or a creatinine clearance which\\nhas dropped to <70 ml/min with Stribild\\n®, the renal function should be checked\\nagain within a week.

The increased renal risk observed in early cohort studies\\nwas less explicit in more recent analyses – possibly because TDF is now being used\\nmore carefully by the treating physicians. Studies verified an increased tubular risk\\nwith TDF (Dauchy 2011) higher than that with ABC+3TC (Moyle 2010). Although\\na meta-analysis of 17 studies showed only a slight reduction of GFR on TDF \\n(-3.92 ml/min) and a slightly increased risk of renal failure (+0.7%), TDF should not\\nbe used uncritically or without regular monitoring of renal function (Cooper 2010).\\nIn the large D:A:D cohort (n=22,603), a decline in GFR of more that 20 ml to less\\nthan 70 ml/min correlated with the use of TDF, boosted atazanavir and lopinavir\\n(Derek 2013). This was also seen in the EuroSIDA cohort, in which renal failure inci-\\ndence amounted to 1.05 per 100 patient years. Again, there was a correlation between\\nthe use of TDF, atazanavir/r and lopinavir/r. In contrast to the D:A:D group, patients\\nwith renal insufficiency were not excluded in EuroSIDA study (Derek 2013). The inci-\\ndence of renal events in the manufacturer’s database since drug approval amounts\\nto 29.2 per 100,000 patient-years (Nelson 2006). In two prospective studies (GS903E\\nand GS934) on patients with good renal health, a creatinine increase to >1.5 mg/ml\\nwas observed in less than 1% of patients during an observation period of 144 weeks,\\nand proteinuria of more than 100 mg/dl in less than 5%. However, patients suffer-\\ning from renal insufficiency were excluded from these studies (Gallant 2008).\\nThe leading renal event during TDF treatment is Fanconi’s syndrome (22.4/100,000\\npatient-years, a combination of hypophosphatemia, glucosuria (renal diabetes\\n mellitus with normal blood sugar) and a mild proteinuria.

HIV and Cardiac Diseases\\nACHIM BARMEYER, MARKUS UNNEWEHR\\nWith growing age and duration of the disease, the prevalence of cardiovascular dis-\\neases is increasing in HIV+ patients. The increase of cardiovascular morbidity results\\nfrom an elevated cardiovascular risk profile as well as being a direct consequence of\\nHIV infection itself. Knowledge of the diagnosis and therapy of HIV-associated\\n cardiovascular disease is becoming more and more important (Neumann 2002a,\\nDakin 2006). \\nCoronary artery disease (CAD)\\nHIV+ patients show a higher prevalence of CAD (Currier 2003) and a higher inci-\\ndence of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) (Klein 2002, Triant 2007), especially acute\\nmyocardial infarctions (MI), compared to HIV-negative individuals. It also appears\\nthat cardiovascular events occur earlier. The higher cardiovascular morbidity might\\nbe attributable to three possible major causes: negative effects of ART, a direct impact\\nof HIV infection and a higher cardiovascular risk profile.\\nThe effect of ART on cardiovascular morbidity was investigated in a number of\\nstudies. ART was associated with a higher incidence of CAD (Currier 2003), the\\n development of atherosclerosis (Jericó 2006, de Saint Martin 2006) and incidence of\\ncoronary vascular events (Iloeje 2005). In the D:A:D study, including more than\\n23,000 patients, a 26% increase in MI incidence was found with each year of ART\\nexposure (Friis-Moller 2003, Law 2006). However, the event rate was low, with \\n3.5 MIs per 1000 patient-years. Antiretroviral therapy was an independent risk factor\\nfor CAD along with the classical cardiovascular risk factors like age, gender and par-\\nticularly smoking (Law 2006). \\nOf interest is the effect of NRTIs on the occurrence of myocardial infarction. The\\nD:A:D study reported an increased rate of MI for abacavir and ddI (Sabin 2008). An\\nelevated incidence of cardiovascular events was also found in a retrospective  analysis\\nof the SMART study as well as in another retrospective analysis of a Danish work-\\ngroup (Obel 2010). Inflammation may be the cause of this increased cardiovascular\\nevent rate (Lundgren 2008b). On the contrary, a recent FDA meta-analysis plotting\\ndata of almost 10,000 patients could not find a statistically significant difference of\\nMI events between subjects receiving abacavir-containing ART and other ART\\n regimens (Ding 2011). When using PIs, the increased event rate was associated with\\nclassical risk factors such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia which may explain some\\nof the events. Patients undergoing therapy with abacavir also were likely to be male\\nand had an increased rate of risk factors like increased age, diabetes and pre-exist-\\ning cardiovascular disease. Further investigation is needed to clarify how much\\n classical risk factors contribute to the MI event rate. When looking at NNRTIs and\\nsome PIs (nelfinavir, saquinavir) and NRTIs (AZT, d4T, 3TC, tenofovir) there was no\\nhint of an increased cardiovascular event rate (Worm 2010). To what extent these\\nresults have an effect on medical care of HIV-infected patients remains unclear. \\nHowever, the SMART study did show an increase in the cardiovascular event rate in\\npatients in whom ART was discontinued intermittently compared to patients who\\nreceived ART continuously (El-Sadr 2006). It was suggested that increased inflam-\\nmation during treatment interruption is responsible for this (Kuller 2008). \\nSumming up, the evidence for negative effects of ART on CAD is not strong enough\\nto influence the decision of when to start or switch ART regimens in terms of the\\ncardiovascular risks. \\n587'),\n",

HIV+ men exhibited slightly more positive arterial remodel-\\ning on coronary CT than negative controls (Miller 2015). Also, the prevalence of\\ncoronary calcium is higher (Chow 2015). However, in a sonographic controlled study\\nof the development of carotid plaques HIV+ patients with high baseline CD4 T cells\\ndid not have an increased risk compared to normal controls. It was concluded that\\nthe degree of immunodeficiency might play a role in the progression of atheroscle-\\nrosis. Studies focusing on subclinical atherosclerosis predict an increasing prevalence\\nof CAD in the near future as the population continues to age (Triant 2009, Lo 2010). \\nIt has been shown that HIV+ subjects exhibit a marked cardiovascular risk profile\\n(Neumann 2003+2004a+b). Most notably, cigarette consumption is two- to three-\\nfold higher than in non-infected populations. In addition, uncontrolled blood\\n pressure is frequent in HIV+ patients (Nuernberg 2015) and a recent publication\\nrevealed that treatment of risk factors is frequently insufficient (Reinsch 2012).\\nEspecially patients with known CAD and diabetes exhibit a high risk for subsequent\\ncardiovascular events (CAD: 7.5-fold; diabetes: 2.4-fold) (Worm 2009).\\nPrevention and treatment of CAD\\nPrevention and early diagnosis of CAD in patients older than 45 years and with an\\nelevated cardiovascular risk profile should, therefore, be routine in current thera-\\npeutic management of HIV infection. Primary and secondary prevention should aim\\nat modifying known risk factors (Lundgren 2008a). Prevention of CAD is based on\\nthe most recent general guidelines (Smith 2006, Perk 2012) (Table 1) and EACS guide-\\nlines (Lundgren 2008a). A number of different scores for calculation of the cardio-\\nvascular risk profile is proposed. However, all of them take into account the classi-\\ncal risk factors hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension and smoking. Primary\\nprevention of CAD aims at the control of these risk factors to lower the future risk\\nof cardiovascular events. \\nPrimary prevention of CAD starts by modifying lifestyle and comprises cessation of\\nsmoking and a balanced diet with a low content of saturated fatty acids and trans-\\nunsaturated fatty acids, a reduced salt intake as well as a high amount of fibers, fruits\\nand vegetables. Moderate intensity physical activity with a cumulative duration of\\n2.5–5 hours per week is recommended. Weight reduction which aims at a BMI of \\n20–25 is beneficial for the control of blood pressure and metabolic imbalance.\\nIf control of blood pressure cannot be achieved with lifestyle modifications only,\\ndrug therapy should be initiated.

Inhibition of the\\nisoenzyme 3A4 can increase the blood concentration of statins and induce side\\neffects. In contrast to most other statins, pravastatin and fluvastatin are not modu-\\nlated by isoenzyme 3A4.

In HIV+ patients,\\nHIV-associated dilated cardiomyopathy is of major interest. It corresponds to a\\nreduced systolic function with a dilated and less contractile left ventricle (Dakin\\n2006, Butt 2012). Myocarditis is still the most thoroughly studied cause of conges-\\ntive heart failure in HIV disease. Until now, a variety of pathogens has been found\\nin the myocardial tissue of HIV+ patients (Patel 1996, Wu 1992). Furthermore, HIV\\nitself appears to infect myocardial cells in a patchy distribution. Myocardial damage\\nby gp120 and cytokine-mediated apoptosis is presumed (Fiala 2004). Especially, HIV-\\n1 is known to cause cardiomyopathy (Lopes de Campos 2014). In addition to a direct\\nimpact of HIV or other pathogens, dilated cardiomyopathy was reported in associ-\\nation with an autoimmune reaction. Cardiac-specific autoantibodies (anti-\\n/H9251-myosin\\nantibodies) have been reported in up to 30% of HIV+ patients with cardiomyopa-\\nthy. However, several studies indicate that dilated cardiomyopathy is associated with\\ncardiotoxic agents (e.g., pentamidine, interleukin-2, doxorubicin) or caused by mal-\\nnutrition (Nosanchuk 2002). Furthermore, it is under discussion whether antiretro-\\nviral drugs may induce cardiac dysfunction due to mitochondrial toxicity (Lewis\\n2006, Purevjav 2007). A retrospective study of a large cohort showed an association\\nof tenofovir intake and incident heart failure (Choi 2011).  \\nThe prevalence of congestive heart failure in the pre-ART era was between 9% and\\n52% (Ntsehke 2005) and 29% in patients with AIDS (Levy 1989). Since the intro-\\nduction of ART the prevalence of dilated cardiomyopathy seems to have decreased.\\nIn an Italian cohort a prevalence of 1.8% at the end of the 1990s was reported\\n(Pugliese 2000). In a recent register study the rate of death due to  cardiomyopathy\\nwas higher than in negative controls. However, the rate of death due to heart failure\\nwas lower (Whiteside 2015). \\nIn recent years, growing evidence has been found that not only systolic function\\ncan be impaired in HIV+ patients but also diastolic function. (Schuster 2008, Hsue\\n2010, Reinsch 2011, Blaylock 2012). However, impairment of diastolic function was\\noften asymptomatic. There is uncertainty about the causes for diastolic impairment,\\nalthough there is evidence that it seems to be mainly related to HIV infection itself\\nrather than to ART (Fontes-Carvalho 2015).\\nChronic heart failure is associated with a reduced life expectancy. In cases of NYHA\\nIII-IV , the annual mortality rate rises to 25%. While in some cases a total recovery\\nhas been described (Fingerhood 2001, Tayal 2001), the majority of patients with HIV-\\nassociated dilated cardiomyopathy have a progression of left ventricular dysfunction\\nand a poor prognosis (Felker 2000). It is unclear whether ART has an influence on\\nthe recovery of ventricular function. Potentially helpful for the assessment of\\n prognosis in HIV cardiomyopathy is the evaluation of contractile reserve by stress\\nechocardiography (Wever-Pinzon 2011). Early diagnosis and conventional therapy\\nseem to be the most promising ways to reduce disease progression.\\nUnfortunately, heart failure is often not recognized. In a prospective study of 416\\nHIV+ patients with unknown heart disease the frequency of cardiac dysfunction was\\n17.7% (Twagirumukza 2007). Diastolic dysfunction was found in up to 48% of\\n subjects in the HIV-HEART study (Reinsch 2010). Besides left ventricular dysfunc-\\ntion, cardiomyopathy often includes dilatation and reduced contraction of the right\\nventricle. However, a Danish study that enrolled 90 HIV+ patients did not find an\\nincreased rate of right ventricular dysfunction (Kjaer 2006). \\nThe diagnosis of chronic heart failure is based on clinical findings and symptoms.\\nIn addition to exercise intolerance, patients often exhibit dyspnea and edema.\\nNocturia, night cough (cardiac asthma), peripheral cyanosis and weight increase may\\n590 Interdisciplinary Medicine'),\n",

The spectrum ranges from acute or chronic pericarditis to an acute\\npericardial tamponade (Silva-Cardoso 1999, Park 2010). Causes may include HIV\\nitself, opportunistic pathogens, immune reconstitution syndrome or neoplasms\\n(Stotka 1989). In HIV+ patients, infectious pericarditis by rare pathogens such as\\nrhodococcus equi (Gundelly 2014) or mycobacterium avium complex (Babu 2014)\\ncan be found. Yet, in African cohorts by far the most frequent cause of pericardial\\neffusion is tuberculous pericarditis (Reuter 2005). However, non-HIV-associated\\ncauses of pericardial effusion, such as uremia, trauma, irradiation, and drugs have\\nto be considered. In some cases of lipodystrophy an increase in the cardiac lipid\\ntissue could simulate an extensive pericardial effusion (Neumann 2002b). Chronic\\npericardial effusion can lead to constrictive pericarditis, which is characterized by\\nimpairment of diastolic filling due to a rigid and non-compliant pericardium.\\nEchocardiography is referred to as the standard method for diagnosis and follow-up\\nof pericardial disease. Nevertheless, further diagnosis should be performed by com-\\nputer tomography and/or magnetic resonance tomography if neoplasm or an\\nincrease in the cardiac lipid tissue is suspected. Diagnostic pericardial puncture can\\nbe performed to confirm the cause.\\nTreament of pericardial effusion\\nIf possible, a causative therapy should be applied. Additional treatment comprises\\n10–14 days NSAID plus 3 months colchicine (2 × 0.5 mg; 1 × 0.5 mg in patients \\n<70 kg). Pericardial puncture and pericardial tamponade can be performed in symp-\\ntomatic patients. Pericardiotomy might be an option in chronic pericardial effusion.\\nIn cases of constrictive pericarditis, pericardiectomy must be considered.\\nCardiac arrhythmias\\nHIV infection appears to lead to alterations of the autonomic nervous system and\\nof cardiovagal autonomic function with a reduction in heart rate variability (Chow\\n2011). Cardiac arrhythmias can depend on medication. Antiretroviral drugs, e.g.,\\nefavirenz, foscarnet, pentamidine, or therapy with methadone, are expected to\\nprolong the QT interval, an alteration in ECG that may cause Torsade de pointes\\ntachycardia (Castillo 2002). Further drug combinations such as macrolides and chi-\\nnolones may have the same effect on the QT interval. Results of the HIV-Heart study\\nshowed that prolongation of the QT interval is frequently found (20%). However, a\\ncorrelation with antiretroviral drugs was not established (Reinsch 2009). Another\\nprospective study also showed no correlation between QT prolongation and therapy\\nwith PIs (Charbit 2009).\\n592 Interdisciplinary Medicine'),\n",

The hypothesis that HIV infection alone makes someone more susceptible\\nto infective endocarditis has not been validated. However, intravenous drug users\\nhave a ten- to twelve-fold increased risk for infective endocarditis than non-intra-\\nvenous drug users. Also, in intravenous drug users infection of the tricuspid valve is\\nmore frequent. The most frequent germ is Staphylococcus aureus, detected in more\\nthan 40% of HIV+ patients with bacterial endocarditis. Further pathogens include\\nStreptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae (Currie 1995). Mycotic forms of\\nendocarditis, which may also occur in patients who are not intravenous drug users,\\nmostly belong to Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida species or Cryptococcus neoformans\\nand are associated with a worse outcome.\\nA retrospective study showed no difference in the clinical outcome of Staphylococcus\\naureus endocarditis comparing HIV+ and -negative patients (Fernandez 2009). Signs\\nof infective endocarditis include fever (90%), fatigue and lack of appetite. An addi-\\ntional heart murmur may also be present (30%). In these cases, repeated blood\\n cultures should be taken and transesophageal echocardiography is mandatory (Bayer\\n1998). Due to the fact that detection of the infectious agent is often difficult, antibi-\\notic therapy should be started early when endocarditis is presumed (Duke criteria),\\neven without the microbiology results. \\nAntibiotic prophylaxis of endocarditis is not generally recommended.

Therefore, HIV seems to be an important cause\\nof PAH. Compared to other forms, HIV-associated PAH has a worse prognosis.\\nThe etiology of HIV-associated PAH is a combination of vasoconstriction and  vascular\\nremodeling with endothelial dysfunction, proliferation of endothelial and smooth\\nmuscle cells and finally vessel obliteration. As the majority of HIV+ subjects does\\nnot develop pulmonary hypertension, a complex genesis including genetic predis-\\nposition is likely. At the beginning there is inflammation which is fueled by HIV\\nproteins tat, PG120 and in particular nef (Hassoun 2009). Pulmonary hypertension\\nleads to an increased afterload of the right ventricle with hypertrophy, right heart\\ndilatation and finally heart failure.\\nIn a prospective study, women were more likely to be affected (1:1.4) by HIV-asso-\\nciated PAH, and intravenous drug abuse was the most common route of infection\\n(53%) (Krings 2007, Reinsch 2008). \\nFortunately, only a small proportion of patients with PAH become symptomatic.\\nDyspnea on exertion is the most common symptom of pulmonary hypertension. At\\nthe time of diagnosis 2/3 of patients can be classified in advanced stages of heart\\nfailure (NYHA III/IV). Further symptoms are lower limb edema, (dry) cough, syncope,\\nangina, fatigue and weakness.\\nOn physical examination one should pay attention to signs of right heart failure,\\nsuch as edema, tachycardia, jugular vein distention and hepatomegaly. On auscul-\\ntation one may find right parasternal systolic murmur indicating tricuspid insuffi-\\nciency and a split second heart sound. \\nBased on clinical suspicion (dyspnea, syncope, edema, cough) further diagnostic\\nwork-up should consider pulmonary hypertension as a possible diagnosis. ECG \\nand chest x-ray show indirect signs. With the help of transthoracic echocardiogra-\\nphy one can estimate systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) and assess right\\n ventricular form and function. In the case of elevated sPAP and signs of right\\n ventricular strain pulmonary hypertension is probable. For definite diagnosis and\\nacute vasodilator testing right heart catheterization is mandatory. To rule out other\\npossible reasons for pulmonary hypertension such as chronic obstructive pulmonary\\ndisease or  pulmonary thromboembolism, a CT scan and lung function test are often\\nneeded.\\nTreatment of PAH\\nPatients with HIV-associated pulmonary hypertension should be diagnosed and fol-\\nlowed in a specialized center. There are several therapeutic options to reduce pul-\\nmonary artery pressure (Montani 2013). There is conflicting evidence if ART can\\nreverse PAH. In a small retrospective study, decrease of pulmonary artery pressure\\nwas observed under ART (Zuber 2004). However, in another study, no improvement\\nof hemodynamic parameters was observed under ART (Degano 2010). \\nThe world consensus conferences in Dana Point and in Nice acknowledged the\\nendothelin receptor antagonists bosentan and ambrisentan as well as sildenafil as\\nclass A for PAH WHO functional class II. Metabolism of sildenafil interferes with PIs\\nsuch as ritonavir so that increased plasma level concentrations can be expected.\\nTherefore, careful dosing is required (Chinello 2012). Further therapeutic substances\\nin more advanced stages of PAH include derivates of prostacyclin intravenously, sub-\\ncutaneously and by inhalation (Barst 2009).\\nHIV-associated PAH has only been studied in uncontrolled clinical trials. Bosentan\\nand long-term infusion of epoprostenol seem to improve hemodynamics and  exercise\\ntolerance (Sitbon 2004). General measures include diuretics, oral anticoagulation,\\noxygen and if appropriate digoxin and rehabilitation. Physical stress and pregnancy\\nshould be avoided.

HIV and Respiratory Diseases\\nMARKUS UNNEWEHR, MARTIN HOWER, BERNHARD SCHAAF\\nThe spectrum of lung diseases in encompasses typical HIV-related  complications such\\nas TB and PCP, bacterial pneumonia, lymphomas and HIV-associated pulmonary\\nhypertension, but also includes usual respiratory problems like acute bronchitis and\\nasthma (see Table 1). Due to the better management of HIV+ people, comorbidities\\nof the older patient become more important, such as COPD, bronchial carcinomas\\nand lung fibrosis (Staitieh 2014, Feldman 2014). With ART, PCP and TB have become\\nless frequent and pulmonary mortality has decreased (Grubb 2006, Morris 2011).\\nHIV influences toll-like receptors and other factors of immune function that increase\\nthe risk of pneumonia (Morris 2011). Particularly in patients with respiratory pro-\\nblems and advanced immune deficiency, it is essential to take all differential diag-\\nnoses into consideration, of which this chapter presents an outline. PCP, myco-\\nbacterial infections and pulmonary hypertension are covered in detail in other\\nchapters.\\nTable 1: Pulmonary complications in HIV+ patients\\nInfections Neoplasia Other\\nPneumocystis jiroveci Kaposi sarcoma (KS) Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP) \\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma Non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP)\\nBacterial pneumonia Hodgkin lymphoma Cr yptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP)\\nS. pneumoniae Bronchial carcinoma Pulmonary hypertension\\nS. aureus Multicentric Castleman’s COPD\\nH. influenzae disease (e.g., mediastinal Bronchial hyperreactivity\\nB. catarrhalis lymph nodes)\\nP . aeruginosa Side effects of ART:\\nRhodococcus equi Dyspnea + cough in hypersensitivity\\nNocardia asteroides reaction to abacavir\\nDyspnea + tachypnea in lactic acidosisMycobacteria Pneumonia with T-20 therapyM. tuberculosis Pulmonary infiltration, lymph nodes and Atypical mycobacteria fever in IRIS\\nOther\\nCytomegalovirus (CMV)\\nAspergillus spp.\\nCryptococcus neoformans\\nHistoplasma capsulatum\\nToxoplasma gondii\\nTalking with the patient\\nThe most important question: What is the immune status? The number of CD4\\nT cells is an excellent marker of the patient’s individual risk of opportunistic infec-\\ntions. More important than the trough level (nadir) is the current CD4 T cell count.\\nAbove 200 cells/µl, typical opportunistic infections are unlikely. In these patients,\\ngenerally “usual” problems such as acute bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia can\\nbe expected. However, TB should always be considered. Although the risk increases\\nwith immunodeficiency, more than half of HIV+ TB patients have more than \\n200 cells/µl (Wood 2000, Lange 2004).\\n600'),\n",

Pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma and\\n pulmonary Toxoplasma gondii infection tend to appear at less than 100 cells/µl but\\nare rarely seen. Below 50 cells/µl, pulmonary infections with CMV (mostly in\\n combination with PCP), invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), endemic fungi\\n(Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis) and infections with atypical mycobac-\\nteria occur. Especially in patients with advanced immunodeficiency, pulmonary\\ndisease might be an indicator of a systemic infection (e.g., aspergillosis). Rapid\\n invasive diagnostics are advisable in patients with low CD4 T cells. \\nWhat are the signs and symptoms? PCP patients typically have dyspnea and a non-\\nproductive cough. A large quantity of discoloured sputum is more likely to indicate\\na bacterial cause or a combination of infections. Usually, bacterial pneumonia is of acute\\nonset. These patients usually see a doctor after 3-5 days of discomfort (Cilloniz 2014).\\nWhat is the medical history of the patient? Someone who has had PCP previously\\nis at higher risk of having it again. A patient with COPD might have just an exac-\\nerbation of his pulmonary disease. \\nWhat medication should the patient be on? Under 200 CD4, PCP is unlikely with\\ncotrimoxazole prophylaxis and the risk of bacterial pneumonia may be reduced (Beck\\n2001). When pentamidine inhalation is used for PCP prophylaxis, however,  atypical\\nPCP can present in the upper lobes. \\nHas the patient recently started ART? Respiratory symptoms after starting ART\\nmight result from immune reconstitution and inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). IRIS\\nmay have infectious and non-infectious causes (Grubb 2006). Low CD4 T cell count\\nand high viral load are risk factors. In a retrospective analysis, IRIS was seen in 30%\\nof patients with TB, atypical mycobacteriosis and cryptococcosis (Shelburn 2005). \\nBecause of HLA testing, hypersensitivity to abacavir is rarely seen today. Dyspnea\\n(13%), cough (27%) and pharyngitis (13%) are common symptoms of hypersensi-\\ntivity (Keiser 2003). Some patients even develop pulmonary infiltrates. T-20 seems\\nto increase the risk of bacterial pneumonia, at least among smokers. Dyspnea and\\ntachypnea are also seen as symptoms of lactic acidosis secondary to NRTI therapy. \\nDoes the patient smoke? Smoking is more harmful to HIV+ than to negative persons,\\nand is more common (Crothers 2011). Smoking promotes local immunodeficiency\\nin the lung. It reduces the number of alveolar CD4 T cells and the production of\\nimportant pro-inflammatory cytokines (Wewers 1998) and suppresses the phago-\\ncytic capacity of alveolar macrophages (Elssner 2004). Both HIV-associated and -inde-\\npendent pulmonary diseases are more common in smokers. This applies to bacter-\\nial pneumonia and PCP, but also to asthma, COPD and pulmonary carcinoma\\n(Hirschtick 1996, Crothers 2011). \\nMotivating the HIV+ patient to quit smoking is important. Promising strategies that\\nare supported by scientific evidence are brief verbal interventions, participation in\\nmotivational groups, nicotine substitutes and bupropion medications. For bupro-\\npion, interactions with boosted ARVs should be taken into consideration. The\\nSmoking Cessation Handbook of the US Department of Veterans Affairs\\n(http://www.va.gov/vhapublications/ViewPublication.asp?pub_ID=2826) provides\\npractical assistance (Veterans Health Administration 2012).\\nWhat is the patient’s geographical background? An important question is the\\ntravel history and/or background of the patient. Histoplasmosis, for example, is more\\nwidespread in certain parts of the US and in Puerto Rico than PCP, yet is rare in\\nEurope. Coccidioidomycosis can occur endemically. TB is more frequent in immi-\\ngrants from high-prevalence countries. \\nHIV and Respiratory Diseases    601'),\n",

In patients on ART,\\n pulmonary infections are less frequent while non-infectious pulmonary diseases are\\nmore frequent (Crothers 2011, Morris 2011).\\nBacterial pneumonia\\nBacterial pneumonia occurs more often in HIV+ patients (Crothers 2011) and like\\nPCP, leaves scars in the lung. This often results in a persistent restrictive lung func-\\ntion impairment (Alison 2000) and significantly worsens the long-term prognosis of\\nthe patient (Osmond 1999). The risk increases with higher immunosupression and\\nage. Thus, acquiring bacterial pneumonia more than once a year is regarded as AIDS-\\ndefining. The introduction of ART resulted in a significant decrease of bacterial pneu-\\nmonia (Jeffrey 2000, Grau 2005, Madeddu 2009, Crothers 2011).\\nHowever, HIV+ patients more often present with fewer symptoms and a normal leu-\\ncocyte count (Feldman 1999). Below 200 CD4 T cells/µl, multifocal and interstitial\\nmanifestations are more common in pneumococcus infections (Rizzi 2008). The CD4\\nT cell count is important for the risk stratification (Lim 2003), in addition to the\\nusual criteria of the CRB-65 score (confusion, respiratory rate, blood pressure, age\\n>65 years). The mortality of patients with less than 100 CD4 T cells/µl is increased\\nby more than six-fold. To have a low threshold to admit severely immunocompro-\\nmised patients to hospital is probably more reasonable than to rely on risk scores\\n602 Interdisciplinary Medicine'),\n",

However, at a CD4 T cell\\ncount lower than 200/µl there is no proof of benefit. Due to the frequency of\\n secondary bacterial infections, an annual influenza vaccination is advisable.\\nCOPD and Emphysema \\nCOPD is, along with pneumonia, the most common pulmonary complication in\\nHIV+ patients (Crothers 2011). Probability of developing lung emphysema is higher\\n(Crothers 2006) and quality of life is reduced (Drummond 2010). Each patient should\\nbe asked about COPD symptoms such as cough, dyspnea and sputum, and a spirom-\\netry test should be offered. A pathogenetic synergy from smoking and pulmonary\\ninfiltration with cytotoxic T cells due to HIV infection is possible (Diaz 2000, Yearsley\\n2005, Caner 2009). ART was shown as an independent factor for developing bronchial\\nobstruction and COPD if this occurs in IRIS (George 2009). Smoking cocaine (crack)\\nincreases the risk of pulmonary  emphysema even more. In this case, it seems that\\nsuperficial epithelial and mucosal structures are destroyed (Fliegil 1997).\\nFurthermore, crack can sometimes cause  pneumothorax or alveolar infiltrates.\\nBronchial Asthma\\nBesides COPD, bronchial asthma is the most common pulmonary comorbidity in\\nHIV+ patients and is more frequent than in negative individuals (Drummond 2014).\\nIn case of cough, dyspnea or recurrent bronchitis, a hyperreactive bronchial system\\nas a sign of asthma should be considered. It is not clear whether the immunosup-\\npression of HIV protects patients from exaggerated immune reactions like allergies\\nand asthma. In the pre-ART era the incidence of asthma seemed to be not influenced\\nby the presence of HIV (Wallace 1997). A recent US study shows a lower incidence\\nof asthma with ART and low viral load (Crothers 2011).\\nInhaled corticosteroids should not be combined with boosted ARVs because of the\\nrisk of hypercortisolism (Cushing syndrome). Other inhaled medications, however,\\ndo not seem to be influenced by ART. Since steroids are the treatment of first choice\\nfor asthma, an ART change may be reasonable. Integrase inhibitors do not affect the\\ncortisol levels. In COPD patients, corticosteriods should be considered with caution\\n(Drummond 2014). Of note, HIV+ children have more asthma (Siberry 2012).\\nImmunoreconstitution with ART is associated with an increase of asthma incidence\\nin children (Foster 2008). \\nLung Fibrosis and Lymphoid Interstitial Pneumonia (LIP)\\nLung fibrosis is a rare disease, but more frequent in HIV+ patients (Crothers 2011).\\nManifestations like COP, NSIP, UIP and alveolar proteinosis have been described\\n(Crisan 2009). LIP is a form of pneumonia with a chronic or subacute course and is\\nextremely rare in adults. Its reticulonodular X-ray pattern is similar to PCP. LIP occurs\\nparaneoplastic, rarely idiopathic, and can be caused by infections such as HIV and\\nEBV.

Definite diagnosis often calls for an open\\npulmonary biopsy. LIP is considered sensitive to steroids. LIP can occur in the context\\nof the Diffuse Infiltrative Lymphocytic Syndrome (DILS), at which DC8-lymphocytic\\ninfiltrates manifest in the parotid glands and other organs (Ghrenassia 2015). The\\nrole of ART is unclear, especially as LIP has occasionally been observed in the context\\nof immune reconstitution during ART. Other interstitial pneumonias, like crypto-\\ngen organizing pneumonia (COP with BOOP as histology) or nonspecific interstitial\\npneumonitis (NSIP) are also seen in association with HIV (Khater 2004).\\nBronchial Carcinoma (BC)\\nMultiple studies, including one meta-analysis, show a two- to eight-fold increased\\nincidence of bronchial carcinoma (Hessol 2006, Shiels 2009, Polesel 2010, Crothers\\n2011, Hoffmann 2013).

See chapter on Non-AIDS-defining\\nMalignancies. \\nLess common opportunistic infections \\nIn HIV+ children, CMV pneumonia is more often seen than PCP (Zampoli 2011),\\nwhile in adults it is less frequent. The significance of the pathogen in the later stages\\nmay be underestimated, since histological examination of autopsy material showed\\npulmonary CMV infections in up to 17% (Waxman 1997, Afessa 1998, Tang 2005).\\nHowever, in respiratory insufficiency due to PCP, CMV pneumonia should be\\n considered and perhaps treated, because a coinfection has a higher mortality\\n(Boonsarngsuk 2009). The detection of CMV in BAL repeatedly gives rise to  discussion\\nregarding clinical relevance. At over 90%, seroprevalence is high, and colonization\\nof the respiratory tract is common. Transbronchial biopsy may prove CMV infec-\\ntion, blood markers (CMV PCR or pp65 antigen) may be helpful. Regarding invasive\\npulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), which only occurs in the late stages and usually in\\nconjunction with additional risk factors such as neutropenia or steroid therapy\\n(Mylonakis 1998), refer to the chapter AIDS.\\nDiagnostic strategy for pulmonary infiltrates\\nThe intensity of the diagnostic workup in a patient with pulmonary infiltrates is\\nbased on the stage of HIV and the expected spectrum of pathogens. With a CD4 \\nT cell count of more than 200/µl, non-invasive basic diagnostics and a calculated\\nantibiotic therapy are justified. At 25–60%, the rate of bacteremia is higher than in\\nimmunocompetent patients (Miller 1994), so two pairs of blood cultures and a micro-\\nscopic and cultural sputum examination including mycobacteria should be done in\\n inpatient settings. \\nIn advanced stages (below 200 CD4 T cells/µl), and if rapid diagnostic management\\nis possible and does not delay treatment, bronchoscopy is recommended (Dalhoff\\n2002). The diagnostic success rate in HIV+ patients with pulmonary infiltrates is \\n55–70% and reaches 89–90% when all techniques including transbronchial lung\\nbiopsy are combined (Cadranel 1995). The sensitivity of a bronchoalveolar lavage\\n(BAL) is 60–70% in bacterial pneumonia in patients without previous antibiotic treat-\\nment, and 85–100% in PCP (Baughman RP 1994). Due to the high sensitivity of the\\nBAL, transbronchial biopsy with possible complications is only recommended in the\\ndiagnosis of PCP with a negative initial diagnostic workup and in patients taking\\nchemoprophylaxis (Dalhoff 2002). \\n604 Interdisciplinary Medicine'),\n",

HIV-related Thrombocytopenia\\nHEINZ-AUGUST HORST\\nThrombocytopenia is one of the most frequently observed hematological complica-\\ntions of HIV infection. The incidence increases among patients not receiving\\n adequate antiretroviral treatment and does not appear to vary according to the mode\\nof acquisition of HIV (Heyward 1988, Finazzi 1990, Sloand 1992). A 10-year cumu-\\nlative incidence of up to 45% has been reported (Eyster 1993). In patients with\\n previously well controlled HIV infection a discontinuation of ART can lead to the\\nrapid occurrence of thrombocytopenia (Bouldouyre 2009). Thrombocytopenia is\\nmostly mild and asymptomatic. Platelet counts of <30,000/µl have only been seen\\nin less than 10% of the cases with HIV-related thrombocytopenia (Mientjes 1992,\\nVannappagari 2011). HIV-related thrombocytopenia has been generally attributed\\nto two different mechanisms: First, an immunologically driven destruction of the\\nplatelets and second, an insufficient platelet production by the megakaryocytes.\\nWhile in early HIV infection increased platelet destruction appears to be predomi-\\nnant, production failure is often the main cause of thrombocytopenia in late-stage\\npatients (Najean 1994). \\nTable 1: Differential diagnoses of thrombocytopenia, except HIV\\n• Pseudo-thrombocytopenia\\n• Toxic bone marrow suppression: drugs, e.g., TMP-SMX, rifampicin, ethambutol, radiation\\n• Infection: HCV, H. pylori, CMV, MAC\\n• Malignant lymphoproliferative B cell disorders: e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, \\ndiffuse large B cell lymphoma \\n• Immunologic: Systemic lupus erythematodes, immune thyroiditis, Evans syndrome, heparin\\n• Other causes: HUS, TTP , PNH, hypersplenism, liver cirrhosis\\nClinical manifestations\\nThe clinical course is often asymptomatic. However, a spectrum of bleeding prob-\\nlems including petechiae, epistaxis, ecchymosis, menorrhagia, hemorrhage of the\\ngingivae may occur. Severe bleeding of the gastrointestinal tract or the CNS are rarely\\nobserved and are most likely at platelet counts <30,000/µl. In contrast to patients\\nwith immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients often present with\\nsplenomegaly and lymph node enlargement. Spontaneous remissions of HIV-related\\nthrombocytopenia have been observed in 10–20% of the cases, mostly with mild\\nthrombocytopenias (Walsh 1985, Abrams 1986).\\nRecently, the evaluation of the EuroSIDA data showed a possible association between\\nthrombocytopenia and non-AIDS-related cancer (Borges 2014).\\nDiagnosis\\nHIV-related thrombocytopenia is a repeatedly confirmed isolated decrease of the\\n platelet count <100,000/µl. In the peripheral blood the platelets often show an\\n increased variability in size. In the bone marrow the number of megakaryocytes is\\nnormal or increased.\\nHIV-related thrombocytopenia has to be distinguished from cases of EDTA-induced\\npseudo-thrombocytopenia and from other causes of “true” secondary thrombocy-\\ntopenias, which include myelotoxic drugs, hepatitis C virus (HCV), cytomegalo virus\\n(CMV) and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections. The risk of heparin-\\ninduced thrombocytopenia is probably increased in HIV+ patients (Thompson 2007).\\n607'),\n",

Furthermore, the distinction from thrombotic thrombocy-\\ntopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome is of great importance. These\\ndiseases show a peripheral platelet destruction not related to an immune mecha-\\nnism, occur in higher frequency with HIV infection, and are life threatening.\\nImportant causes of thrombocytopenia are summarised in Table 1.\\nTherapy\\nThe therapy is based on two principles: antiretroviral therapy, and in severe cases an\\nadditional treatment with agents used in non- HIV immune thrombocytopenia, i.e.,\\nglucocorticoids, intravenous immunoglobulins, or anti-(Rh)D. In refractory cases\\nsplenectomy is also a treatment option (George 1996, Godeau 2007). The treatment\\nbesides ART is based on the recent international consensus report and the guidelines\\nof the American Society of Hematology (Provan 2010, Neunert 2011). Treatment\\noptions are summarized in Table 2.\\nTable 2: Therapy of HIV-related thrombocytopenia\\nClinical Situation Therapy\\nAsymptomatic and ART\\nthrombocytes >30,000/μl\\nThrombocytes <30,000/μl or ART plus\\nthrombocytes <50,000/μl and First-line therapy: glucocorticoids\\nsignificant mucous membrane bleeding Subsequent therapies*:intravenous immuno-\\nglobulins, anti-(Rh)D, rituximab, splenectomy\\nSevere bleeding Platelet transfusions, high-dose glucocorticoids, intra-\\nvenous immunoglobulins, either alone or in combination \\n* Subsequent therapies after failure of glucocorticoids should be given according to the experience of\\nthe treating physician since only a few prospective randomised studies are available (Vesely 2004)\\nART: leads to a significant recovery of the platelet count within three months of\\ntreatment in most patients (Arranz Caso 1999, Servais 2001). This effect is\\n independent of the antiretrovirals utilised and the platelet count at the start of\\ntherapy (Arranz Caso 1999). Importantly, during treatment interruptions often\\nthrombocytopenias develop, particularly in patients with a history of HIV-related\\nthrombocytopenia (Ananworanich 2003, Bouldouyre 2009). A therapy in addition\\nto ART is indicated for patients with a platelet count <30,000/µl or a platelet count\\nof <50,000/µl with a significant concomitant mucous membrane bleeding or risk\\nfactors for bleeding, such as peptic ulcers or hypertension (George 1996).\\nGlucocorticoids: are currently the standard first-line therapy of HIV-related throm-\\nbocytopenia. A dose of 0.5-1.0 mg/kg body weight prednisolone or prednisone results\\nin a significant increase in platelet counts in 60–90% of the patients (Gottlieb 1983,\\nAbrams 1986). After a response, which can be expected within a few days, the initial\\ndose should be continued for 3-6 weeks. Then, depending on the platelet count,\\nwhich should be kept >60,000/µl, the glucocorticoid dose should be tapered within\\nweeks and discontinued if possible. In the case of a life-threatening bleed we\\n recommend higher dosages (i.e., 1 g methylprednisolone/day for three days with\\nsubsequent dose reduction). In order to avoid a long-lasting therapy with\\n prednisolone or prednisone and possible side effects, a short-term protocol with high-\\ndose dexamethasone may be used. After treatment with 40 mg of dexamethasone\\n608 Interdisciplinary Medicine'),\n",

A relapse does occur in 50% of the respond-\\ning patients within six months. These patients require a prolonged therapy with\\n glucocorticoids or a different treatment (Cheng 2003). After four cycles of dexam-\\nethasone given for four days every 14 days in 74% of the patients a long-term response\\n(median time of 8 months) can be seen (Mazzucconi 2007). Using steroids it has to\\nbe kept in mind that particularly prolonged treatment is associated with a high risk\\nof even fatal infectious complications (Portielje 2001, Zimmer 2004).\\nIntravenous immunoglobulins: are costly and often given after failure of gluco-\\ncorticoids, in the case of contraindications against glucocorticoids or in a situation\\nwith life-threatening bleeding. The standard dose is 1 g/kg body weight for 1–2 days.\\nThe response rate is approximately 60%. Without maintenance therapy the platelet\\ncount will decrease in most patients and it drops to the pre-treatment levels after\\nabout a month (Godeau 2007).\\nAnti-(Rh)D: The intravenous anti-(Rh)D application is an interesting treatment\\noption. The mechanism of action is assumed to be mediated through the destruc-\\ntion of antibody-coated (Rh)D positive red blood cells (RBC). The preferential clear-\\nance of antibody-coated RBC by macrophages  particularly in the spleen leads to an\\nFc receptor blockade sparing the destruction of autoantibody-coated platelets\\n(Scaradavou 1997). The response rate in HIV-related thrombocytopenia was 64%\\n(Scaradavou 1997). The peak platelet count was significantly higher and the dura-\\ntion of response significantly longer in HIV+ patients treated with anti-(Rh)D com-\\npared to intravenous immunoglobulins (Scaradavou 2007). WhinRho\\nÒ SDF (Cangene\\nCorporation) is the first anti-D immunoglobulin approved for use in HIV-related\\nthrombocytopenia. The recommended initial dose for adults is 50 µg/kg body weight\\nadministered i.v. by a 3–5 minute infusion. In patients with a hemoglobin level less\\nthan 10 g/dl a reduced dose is recommended. It has to be kept in mind that anti-\\n(Rh)D is only suitable for (Rh)D positive patients who are not splenectomized. An\\nimportant adverse event is a decrease of the hemoglobin level by hemolysis. In a\\nlarge study of 272 patients the mean hemoglobin decrease was 0.8 g/dl (Scaradavou\\n1997). Patients with pre-existing hemolysis (Evans syndrome) should not be treated\\nwith anti-(Rh)D.\\nSplenectomy: is effective even after failure of treatment with glucocorticoids and\\nintravenous immunoglobulins. Most studies in HIV+ patients showed a high\\nresponse rate of more than two-thirds of patients with a normalization of the platelet\\ncount in most responders. Although relapses occur, most of the patients show a\\n sustained increase of their platelet count (Oksenhendler 1993). Worsening of the\\nimmunodeficiency by splenectomy leading to an acceleration of the HIV infection\\nwas a major concern about this procedure which, however, was not seen at long\\nterm follow up (Oksenhendler 1993). Independent of HIV status patients undergo-\\ning splenectomy are at increased risk of life-threatening bacterial infections. For\\n prophylaxis polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine, Hemophilus influenzae type b, and\\nmeningococcal vaccine should be given at least two weeks prior to splenectomy. A\\nresponse in HIV+ patients with CD4 T cells of less than 400/µl is uncertain (Greub\\n1996). Considering the other treatment options splenectomy should only be\\n performed in individuals presenting with therapy-resistant severe HIV-related throm-\\nbocytopenia. Particularly because of morbidity splenectomy should be postponed\\nfor at least 6 months after diagnosis since late partial or complete responses can occur\\nsubsequent to efficient HIV suppression and additional therapy of the thrombocy-\\ntopenia.\\nHIV-related Thrombocytopenia    609'),\n",

Successful treatment\\nwas also reported in HIV-related thrombocytopenia (Ahmad 2004). However,\\n particularly in patients with low CD4 T cells (<100/µl), rituximab should only be\\nused after thoroughly considering the possibly increased risk of infections caused by\\nB cell depletion through the anti-CD20 antibody. Several HIV-negative cases of pro-\\ngressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy with fatal outcome have been observed\\nafter rituximab therapy (Carson 2009). A systematic review of the literature on the\\nefficacy of rituximab in adults (age >15 years) with non-HIV immune thrombocy-\\ntopenia revealed a response rate (thrombocytes >50,000/µl) of 62%. A response was\\nusually seen 3–8 weeks after the first infusion of rituximab and lasted from 2–48\\nmonths (Arnold 2007). In patients with relapsed/refractory immune thrompocy-\\ntopenia a replacement of splenectomy by rituximab is being discussed (Godeau 2007).\\nInterferon-/H9251: significantly increased platelet counts in a small randomized, placebo-\\ncontrolled study on patients with HIV-related thrombocytopenia. At a dose of \\n3 million units three times weekly for four weeks an increase of >60,000 platelets/µl\\nwas observed within three weeks of treatment. Subsequent to therapy interruption\\nthe platelet counts slowly returned to pre-treatment values (Marroni 1994). They can\\nbe increased again on reinstitution of interferon-\\n/H9251therapy. Treatment of refractory\\nHIV-related thrombocytopenia may be particularly promising in patients coinfected\\nwith HCV. Adverse events of interferon-\\n/H9251are flu-like symptoms, depression and, less\\nfrequently, cytopenias.\\nThrombopoietin receptor agonists:are a new treatment option in non-HIV immune\\nthrombocytopenia. In a phase III study a platelet response occurred in 79% of the\\nsplenectomized and in 88% of the non-splenectomized patients with non-HIV\\nimmune thrombocytopenia after s.c. treatment with the peptide romiplostim. These\\nresponses were durable (platelet count >50,000/µl for >6 weeks) in 38% of the splenec-\\ntomized and in 61% of the non-splenectomized patients (Kuter 2008). The recom-\\nmended starting dose for romiplostim is 1 µg/kg given s.c. once weekly. It is than\\nadjusted to 1–10 µg/kg weekly according to the platelet count. An increment can be\\nexpected after 7–10 days.\\nA response rate of more than 80% in non-HIV thrombocytopenia was also reported\\nfor the small molecule eltrombopag, which can be administered orally (Bussel\\n2006+2007). The recommended starting dose is 50 mg once daily. It has to be adjusted\\nto 25–75 mg daily according to the platelet count. A platelet response can be expected\\nafter 7–10 days. For patients of East Asian ancestry or patients with moderate or\\nsevere hepatic insufficiency, eltrombopag was approved at a starting dose of 25 mg\\nonce daily. Furthermore, a positive effect of eltrombopag on the platelet count was\\nshown in HIV- and in HCV-associated thrombocytopenia (McHutchison 2007, Quach\\n2012). It might be necessary to adjust the dose of eltrombopag when given with ART.\\nThe co-administration of the PI lopinavir/r lopinavir/ritonavir with eltrombopag\\ndecreased the plasma concentration of eltrombopag by 17% (Wire 2012).\\nRomiplostim and eltrombopag received FDA and EMA approval. A systematic\\n evaluation regarding the role of thrombopoietin receptor agonists in HIV related\\nthrombocytopenia and data on the long-term safety, however, are still missing.\\nPlatelet transfusion: Since the increased platelet destruction is an important mech-\\nanism in HIV-related thrombocytopenia, platelet transfusions are only useful in the\\nrare situation with life-threatening bleeding.

HIV-associated Skin and \\nMucocutaneous Diseases\\nSTEFAN ESSER\\nIntroduction\\nIn comparison to the general population HIV+ patients develop skin diseases more\\noften (Rothengatter 2009). Skin and mucocutaneous diseases are important at the\\nfirst diagnosis of HIV infection and in determining the clinical stage. In 10% of cases,\\nthe diagnosis of HIV infection is based on diseases of the skin and the mucous mem-\\nbranes (Itin 2008). High HIV prevalence was detected in patients with sexually trans-\\nmitted diseases (STDs) and skin diseases like seborrheic dermatitis in the HIV\\nIndicator Diseases across Europe Study (HIDES I, Sullivan 2011).\\nThe spectrum of HIV-associated dermatoses has dramatically changed in recent years\\nwith ART. KS (Friedman-Kien 1981), OIs of the skin (e.g., the rodent ulcer herpes\\nsimplex infections) and the mucous membranes (e.g., Candida infections) have been\\nobserved as marker diseases of acquired immunodeficiency. Almost any HIV-associ-\\nated or AIDS-defining disease can be manifested on the skin and mucous membranes\\nbefore other symptoms appear. The broad spectrum comprises infections from\\nviruses, fungi and bacteria as well as protozoa and parasites (Gottlieb 1981, Siegal\\n1981, Schöfer 1991+1999). KS and OIs have been reduced by the increasing use of\\nART in industrial countries, while side effects and incompatibilities with drugs, virus-\\nand UV-associated epithelial tumors as well as other STDs are on the rise (Costner\\n1998, Sepkowitz 1998, Kreuter 2002, Calista 2002). HIV+ patients should, have\\nregular dermatologic screening tests and treatment.\\nSkin and the mucous membranes are “independent organs” of the immune system.\\nAn immunodeficiency allows even harmless saprophytes on the body surface and\\nfollicle openings to penetrate into deeper tissue layers, and thus develop life-threat-\\nening infections. An increase in wound infections and pyoderma, as well as in clin-\\nically relevant methicillin-resistant infections have been seen in (Burkey 2008). In\\naddition to common dermatoses (e.g., oral candidiasis, herpes zoster, seborrheic der-\\nmatitis) other diseases that have rarely or never been reported have been diagnosed\\nin progressive immunodeficiency (cutaneous cryptococcosis, bacterial angiomatosis,\\noral hairy leukoplakia, Penicillium marneffei infections).\\nIn tropical and subtropical regions, STIs like herpes genitalis, chancroid and other\\nulcerating diseases occurring on the genitals play a decisive role in spreading HIV.\\nSyphilis and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) are experiencing a renaissance in\\nEurope. Homosexual men are the main carriers in this new epidemic. Since 2000,\\nthe number of male syphilis patients in big cities has grown tremendously. In\\nGermany, in 45% of newly registered syphilis infections, HIV infection is diagnosed\\nat the same time (RKI 2008). Circumcisions decrease the risk of sexual transmission\\nof HIV infection (Warner 2009, Giuliano 2009) for men but the best protection is\\nthe use of condoms. \\nThe immune system protects the skin and the mucous membranes against the devel-\\nopment of various malignant tumors (Schöfer 1998). Oncogenic viruses plus immun-\\nodeficiency increase the ratio of many neoplasias in. Some of these are KS (HHV-8),\\nNHL (EBV , HHV-8) as well as cervical and anal carcinoma (HPV , especially HPV-16\\nand -18) (Esser 1998). In HIV+ patients, younger people appear more at risk from\\ncancer (Mitsuyasu 2008). The longer a cellular immunodeficiency exists, the more\\nlikely epithelial tumors will develop that affect the skin and the mucous membrane\\n(basal cell carcinomas, cutaneous and mucocutaneous squamous cell carcinomas).\\n613'),\n",

Despite ART, HPV-associated diseases are\\nincreasing. Due to a rising incidence of anal carcinomas, regular proctological exam-\\ninations are recommended in addition to the current colposcopic monitoring, espe-\\ncially for HIV+ MSM with known condylomata acuminata (Kreuter 2003, DAIG 2013).\\nAvoiding risk factors and regular checkups may help to prevent cancer. The skin and\\nthe mucous membranes are easily accessible and suspicious lesions can be removed\\nat an early stage. \\nKnowledge of diagnosis and therapy of HIV-associated dermatoses is interdiscipli-\\nnary and indispensable for an efficient treatment. \\nDermatological examination and therapy in HIV+ patients\\nInspection of the whole skin surface, the mucous membranes of the mouth, the gen-\\nitals, the anal region as well as palpation of the lymph nodes can be done without\\nany special effort or expense. But even for an experienced physician, diagnostic and\\ntherapeutic problems may arise when examining HIV+ patients – the clinical picture\\nmay differ from textbook knowledge. Skin and mucocutaneous diseases often show\\nan unusual, more serious, faster and therapy-refractory clinical course (Ameen 2010).\\nThe spectrum of causes of an infection may differ considerably from HIV-negative\\npatients (Imaz 2010). The coexistence of several infections means a serious immun-\\nodeficiency. Therefore, it is important to examine lesions correctly before starting\\ntherapy. In case of inconclusive test results or in patients who are in advanced HIV\\nstages punch biopsies should be done to obtain histological reports.\\nStandard treatment of the skin and the mucous membranes might fail in HIV+\\npatients. The main reasons for this are an advanced immunodeficiency as well as\\nresistance. In such cases, a higher dose over a longer period of time should be given,\\nkeeping in mind possible toxic side effects (Osborne 2003). Interactions, e.g., with\\nazole antimycotics or aromatic retinoids, should be considered regarding patients\\non ART. Immunosuppressive therapies should be used cautiously, and only for a short\\nperiod of time. UV treatment (e.g., PUVA therapy for psoriasis) should be considered\\ncarefully and closely supervised when used as viral infections may potentially be\\nprovoked, malignant tumors induced and the HIV viral load increased (Popivanova\\n2010). On the other hand, good therapy results of the UVB 311nm phototherapy in\\ntherapy-refractory itching papular dermatoses has been observed without showing\\ndeterioration of the immunological situation in individual cases. Diagnostics and\\ntherapy can require the whole repertoire of a clinical center primarily specialized in\\ninfectious diseases as well as the interdisciplinary cooperation of different expert groups.\\nART: Influence on skin and mucocutaneous diseases\\nIn the context of life-long treatment, ART-associated side effects are of decisive impor-\\ntance for prognosis, in particular regarding the skin and the mucosa. Regarding exan-\\nthemas, the differentiation of a drug reaction from other causes, e.g., an immune\\nreconstitution syndrome, syphilis or viral exanthema presents a big challenge. The\\nidentification of the agent as the cause of exanthemas is often difficult in patients\\non multiple treatments. \\nThe typical side effects of some drugs (nevirapine, abacavir) are exanthemas.\\nPharmacogenomic HLA-B*5701 tests help to avoid hypersensitivity reaction against\\nabacavir (Mallal 2008). ART may cause lipodystrophy. Lipoatrophy can probably\\ndevelop with some NRTIs, whereas lipohypertrophies are seen with some PIs (Carr\\n1998, Carr 2000). These disorders of adipose tissue are often stigmatizing. But the\\nincidence of the lipodystrophy syndrome has decreased since new antiviral sub-\\nstances and classes with better tolerability have become available (Potthoff 2010). \\n614 Interdisciplinary Medicine'),\n",

The macular exanthema\\nfavors the upper trunk and is characterized as fairly non-pruritic with erythematous\\nmacules from 0.5 to 1 cm in diameter. Morbilliform or rubella-like eruptions and\\npalmoplantar hyperkeratotic eczema occur less frequently. Histopathology reveals a\\nnon-specific perivascular and interstitial infiltrate in the upper- and mid-dermis\\n(Barnadas 1997). Oral aphthous ulcers frequently in combination with shallow\\ngenital ulcers (bipolar aphthosis) are another important clinical symptom (Hulse -\\nbosch 1990, Porras-Luque 1998). Differential diagnosis includes viral infections (EBV ,\\nCMV), Mediterranean spotted fever (Segura 2002), secondary syphilis, drug erup-\\ntions (Hecht 2002, Daar 2001) and Behcet’s disease.\\nAnal cancer: See chapters on STDs (Condylomata acuminata) and Cervical and Anal\\nCancer.\\nAphthous ulcers: At least three different kinds of aphthous ulcers can occur in the\\noral cavity of HIV+ patients. The most frequent diagnosis is recurrent aphthous stom-\\natitis (canker sores) (1) with single or few painful lesions usually localized in the\\nvestibule of the mouth. The ulcers occur at sites of mechanical injuries, are 3 to\\n10 mm in diameter and heal spontaneously after a few days. Single or multiple large\\naphthae (2) which are >1 cm in diameter and usually persist for several weeks are\\nless common. Both variants are of unknown origin (Rogers 1997). In a few cases,\\nespecially when multiple small lesions occur, herpes simplex viruses can be involved.\\nLarge ulcers in combination with severe immunodeficiency can be caused by\\ncytomegalovirus, usually part of a generalized CMV infection. Bipolar aphthosis (3)\\ninvolving the oral and genital mucosal membranes is an important clinical symptom\\nof acute HIV infection or Behcet’s disease. In addition to these clinical variants of\\naphthous ulcers several authors have discussed the direct role of HIV in aphthous\\nstomatitis (Kerr 2003). The treatment of recurrent aphthosis is based on topical anes-\\nthetics and corticosteroids. Large persistent aphthae can require intralesional corti-\\ncosteroids or systemic prednisone. Immunomodulators such as thalidomide are sug-\\ngested for use as prophylaxis in patients with frequent and painful recurrences.\\nFolliculitis: pustular, papular or edematous-papular follicular lesions, involving the\\nproximal limbs and the upper trunk.

These infec-\\ntious, as well as some non-infectious inflammatory skin diseases occur within a few\\ndays to 3 months after the initiation of ART. The therapy depends on the severity\\nof clinical manifestations and consists of specific antibiotics, steroidal and non-\\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (see chapter on IRIS).\\nKaposi sarcoma: the most frequent malignant tumor of the skin and mucosal mem-\\nbranes associated with HIV infection (see chapter on Kaposi’s sarcoma).\\nLipodystrophy: See chapter on Lipodystrophy syndrome. \\nMalignant cutaneous lymphomas: Malignant B and T cell lymphomas are rare in\\nHIV-infected patients (Beylot-Barry 1999, Biggar 2001). Cutaneous B cell lymphomas\\nusually grow as red to violaceous nodules and are easily mistaken for Kaposi’s\\nsarcoma. They can also look like persistent hematoma or non-specific asymptomatic\\npapules. A biopsy should be performed on any clinically unclear tumor of the skin.\\nCutaneous T cell lymphomas are rare malignancies in HIV+ patients. The prevalence\\namong 2,149 HIV-infected patients in Frankfurt was 0.06%. The clinical course starts\\nwith non-specific eczematous patches (Stage I), which are usually not diagnosed as\\ncutaneous lymphoma even after several biopsies because of the paucity of findings\\nsuch as cellular atypia. These lesions are usually diagnosed as eczematous dermati-\\ntis. A linear pattern of patchy or slightly infiltrated lesions in the relaxed skin tension\\nlines can be an early clinical indication of cutaneous T cell lymphoma known as\\nparapsoriasis (Munoz-Peres 1999). Histopathology becomes more evident during the\\nplaque stage (Stage II), and is striking when in Stage III multiple tumors of the mycosis\\nfungoides present. Biggar (2001) calculated a relative risk for cutaneous T cell lym-\\nphomas in HIV+ patients of 15.0 in comparison to the general population. The\\nleukemic phase (Sézary syndrome) is characterized by erythroderma involving the\\npalms and soles. In patients with erythroderma who have darker skin types and lack\\nthe histopathological signs of cutaneous T cell lymphoma the so-called pseudo-Sézary\\nsyndrome has to be considered in the differential diagnosis (Picard-Dahan 1996).\\nTherapy with potent topical steroids (e.g., clobetasol) is effective in the patch and\\nplaque stages. Solitary tumors can be controlled by radiotherapy (20–24 Gy) or\\n photodynamic therapy (Paech 2002). Widespread, multiple tumors and Sézary syn-\\ndrome are treated with a combination of retinoids and interferons or chemother-\\napy. Recently, remission of a CD8-positive pseudolymphoma treated solely with ART\\nwas reported (Schartz 2003).\\nMolluscum contagiosum: A benign viral infection of the skin usually seen in chil-\\ndren and often in association with atopic dermatitis. The pox virus causes multiple\\npapular skin-colored lesions with a typical central umbilication. The diagnosis is\\nusually made on clinical grounds. After several weeks or months, an inflammatory\\nreaction indicates the onset of spontaneous healing. In adults, mollusca are detected\\nin the anogenital area and regarded as a sexually transmitted disease (Agromajor\\n2002). In HIV+ patients, the clinical manifestations can differ significantly from those\\nseen in the normal host. Spontaneous healing is rare; most patients have high\\nnumbers of lesions, typically occurring in the face and neck region, which other-\\nwise is a rare location. The presence of multiple mollusca on the face is a typical\\ndisease marker indicating advanced cell-mediated immunodeficiency (CD4 T cell\\ncount <100/µl) (Schöfer 1991, Schwartz 1992).

Recently, photodynamic therapy with 5-Aminolevulinic\\nacid (Moiin 2003) and imiquimod 5% cream have also shown to be effective (Hengge\\n2000, Calista 1999, Calista 2000, Liota 2000, Smith 2002). Imiquimod is applied by\\nthe patient 3x/week (off-label). An inflammatory reaction (erythema) occurring after\\n3 to 4 weeks of topical treatment indicates the beginning of the immune reaction,\\nwhich leads to complete resolution of the mollusca after 6-8 weeks.\\nOral hairy leukoplakia (OHL):is a clinical manifestation of Epstein-Barr virus infec-\\ntion, almost exclusively found in patients with untreated advanced HIV disease. Non-\\ncytolytic viral replication in the glossal epithelium, especially in the lateral parts of\\nthe tongue, leads to asymptomatic white verrucous plaques that do not rub off. OHL\\nis clinically diagnosed; initially parallel white or grayish hyperkeratotic rows arranged\\nvertically on the lateral aspects of the tongue are characteristic. Unilateral lesions\\nare possible, but bilateral occurrence of several plaques is more typical. Important\\ndifferential diagnoses include other leukoplakias, lichen planus mucosae and oral\\ncandidiasis (Patton 2002, Cherry-Peppers 2003). If the diagnosis is in doubt, a biopsy\\nor cytology can confirm the diagnosis. As the lesions will respond to antiviral drugs\\nsuch as acyclovir, gancyclovir, or foscarnet (Walling 2003) but not antifungals,\\n treatment can be used as a diagnostic tool to distinguish OHL from candidiasis. Both\\ndiseases respond well to ART, which has led to a significant decrease (Triantos 1997,\\nRamirez-Amador 2003).\\nPrurigo nodularis: The stimulus for the development of Prurigo nodularis is Pruritus.\\nPsyche-pruritus-scratch cycles support lesional proliferation of skin nerves for years.\\nNodules (0.5-3cm) develop at a local site in which persistent picking and scratching\\noccur.

The intervening skin shows scales, excoriations, lichenification, post-inflam-\\nmatory pigmentary changes and scars, which can remain even after the healing\\nprocess. Manifold underlying disorders were described along with HIV infection\\n(Liautaud 1989). Psychiatric disorders and emotional tension are often associated\\nwith Prurigo nodularis. There is an affinity to lichen simplex chronicus.\\nComplications of the important dermatoses like atopic dermatitis or insect bites.\\nTherapy: Local: Potent topical glucocorticoids (under occlusion) or intralesional\\ninjection. Polidocanol, calcipotriol, capsaicin; phototherapy (UVB, UVA1) or PUVA\\ntherapy. Some patients have been successfully treated with cryotherapy, laser, elec-\\ntrosurgery and even with excisions. Systemic therapies with sedating antihistamines\\n(interactions may occur), psychopharmacy (neuroleptics, antidepressives), corticos-\\nteroids and retinoids have been used.

Finally,\\nmany antiretrovirals and other drugs can cause pruritus (with or without rash).\\nTo diagnose idiopathic pruritus it is necessary to exclude all skin and systemic  diseases\\nmentioned above. In patients on ART it can be useful to change the treatment\\nregimen. Systemic antihistamines and topical corticosteroids are symptomatic\\n treatment standards. If they are ineffective, or a prolonged systemic treatment is\\n necessary, phototherapy (UVA-1, UVB 311nm) or photochemotherapy (PUVA) is an\\nalternative or adjuvant therapy (Smith 1997, Gelfand 2001, Zirwas 2001, Singh 2003).\\nConcerning the immunosuppressive effects of ultraviolet light, it seems that patients\\non ART are at less risk.\\nPapular dermatoses: Patients can present either with monomorphic skin colored to\\nred papules (size 2–5 mm) or with combined eruptions consisting of papules and\\npustules (sterile eosinophilic pustulosis, Ofuji’s disease). There is no special predilec-\\ntion for any site. The etiology of papular eruptions is heterogeneous. According to\\nthe clinical presentation and laboratory findings (elevation of IgE, eosinophilia in\\nperipheral blood and affected skin) they resemble the prurigo of atopic dermatitis\\nfound in adults. Autoimmune reactions against follicular antigens have also been\\ndiscussed , such as eosinophilic folliculitis (Fearfield 1999). These papules can be due\\nto a hypersensitivity reaction to drugs, microbiological agents (viruses, bacteria,\\nfungi), parasites or saprophytes (Sarcoptes scabiei, Demodex folliculorum, Pityrosporum\\novale and others). A thorough history of drugs, microbiological and histological exam-\\ninations (including special stains such as PAS) are required for a correct diagnosis.\\nIf possible, specific infectious agents are treated. In case of sterile eosinophilic pus-\\ntulosis (Ojufi’s disease) or papular dermatosis of unknown origin, therapy is symp-\\ntomatic. Depending on the clinical situation, antihistamines, itraconazole (200 mg/d\\nfor 2 weeks), isotretinoin, dapsone, mild PUVA or UVB (311nm narrowband UVB is\\nthe most effective therapy) or 5% permethrin cream can be tried (Ellis 2004). Topical\\ntacrolimus (0.1%) has also been shown to be effective (Kawaguchi 2004).\\nParonychia and ingrown nails: Ingrown toenails and inflammatory reactions of\\nthe proximal nailfold are a well known complication in diabetics, but also in patients\\non beta-blockers or retinoid therapy. A few cases might be due to local pressure\\n(wrong shoes) or occur spontaneously. Patients on ART are the latest group of patients\\nto regularly develop ingrown nails. These are ascribed to retinoid-like side effects of\\nseveral antiretrovirals, especially indinavir, but also 3TC. Usually, the large toenails\\nare involved, but all other toenails and fingernails can be affected. Complete remis-\\nsion is often seen when indinavir or 3TC are replaced by other antiretrovirals. Surgical\\nmeasures such as Emmert-plasty or its modification after Hanneke, should only be\\nperformed when changing ART has not led to remission after 3 to 6 months (Tosti\\n1999, Alam 1999, Garcia-Silva 2002).\\nPsoriasis vulgaris: Today, psoriasis is regarded as a polygenic dispositional, chronic\\nsystemic autoimmune disease determined by multifactorial inheritance with  variable\\npenetrance and affects approximately 2% of the general population.

Psoriatic arthritis has a prevalence rate\\nof 7% to 26% of the patients with psoriasis. Psoriasis is increasingly recognized as a\\nsystemic inflammatory process.

Atypical\\nfindings include inverse localization on the palms or soles and in the genital region\\nand axillae, exudative, pustular or erythrodermic manifestations. In general, the\\nseverity of psoriasis parallels the impairment of the immune system. Besides infection,\\ndrugs have to be considered as possible triggers. In the final stages of HIV infection,\\npsoriasis can be generalized and extremely resistant to therapy. Alternatively, the\\ndisease may disappear completely.\\nThe typical psoriatic plaque is a sharply demarcated, erythematous plaque covered\\nwith silvery scales. Clinically and histologically, it may be difficult to differentiate\\nit from seborrheic dermatitis.\\nTriggering factors should be eliminated if possible. Treatment is more difficult if the\\nimmune system is impaired. Antiretroviral therapy should be initiated or optimized.\\nLocalized lesions can be treated topically with corticosteroids, anthralins, dithranol,\\ncalcium-agonists (calcipotriol or tacalcitol), vitamin D3 or the topical retinoid\\ntazarotene. The scalp and nails can be treated topically with corticosteroids.\\nPhototherapy or photochemotherapy have no detrimental effect for HIV patients\\ncompared with other psoriasis patients and that they are justifiable (Akarapathanth\\n1999, Schoppelrey 1999). These treatments are as effective as in patients without\\nHIV infection. UVB 311 (narrowband UVB) is well tolerated and effective. Broadband\\nUVB is an alternative. In case of treatment failure, photochemotherapy can be insti-\\ntuted (local = bath or cream PUVA, or systemic PUVA). Systemic therapy is used addi-\\ntionally in patients with severe psoriasis or topical treatment refractory clinical\\ncourse. Also generalized or exudative eruptions are usually treated systemically.\\nMethotrexate, cyclosporine, fumaric acid esters and retinoids are systemic treatment\\noptions (DDG 2011). Interactions with ART as well as adverse events and immune\\nsuppressive effects of the systemic psoriasis therapy have to be considered. Fumaric\\nacid esters reduce the CD4 and CD8 T cell counts and long term therapy in HIV-neg-\\native psoriasis patients was associated with higher incidences of Kaposi sarcomas\\n(Philipp 2013). Biologicals can modulate the inflammation cascade by reducing the\\nsecretion and the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha. Adalimumab,\\netanercept, infliximab and ustekinumab are highly effective additional or alterna-\\ntive treatment options for patients with severe and therapy refractory psoriasis (DDG\\n2011). Before TNF-alpha blocker are initiated tuberculosis, hepatitis B infection and\\nother clinically relevant opportunistic infections have to be diagnostically excluded.\\nEtanercept and infliximab do not increase the viral load in HIV+ patients (Bartke\\n2004, Ting 2006, Sellam 2007, Morar 2010). Although the total number of cases is\\nrare a higher incidence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy has been\\nobserved in HIV+ patients during treatment with biologicals (Bharat 2012).\\nInteractions of the mentioned antipsoriatics with antiretroviral agents are unknown.\\nReiter’s syndrome: Reiter’s syndrome is regarded as a variant of psoriasis in patients\\nwho carry HLA-B*27. This rare chronic-relapsing disease mainly affects young men,\\nthe incidence being higher than in the general population (0.6% to 6%) (Kaye \\n1989).\\nThe classical triad consists of urethritis (sterile yellow urethral discharge), conjunc-\\ntivitis (serous or purulent) and arthritis (mainly knee-, foot- or sacroiliac joints,\\ncausing pain and leading to immobility). The triad can be found in about 30% of\\npatients. Furthermore, constitutional symptoms (attacks of fever, malaise, leukocy-\\ntosis, elevated ESR) and skin lesions can be found. The skin lesions are characterized\\nHIV-associated Skin and Mucocutaneous Diseases    619'),\n",

Gonorrhea or Chlamydia urethritishave to be excluded\\nby microbiological methods. Psoriatic arthritis should have other clinical signs of\\npsoriasis (nail changes) and lacks fever.\\nInitially symptomatic therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, or pos-\\nsibly corticosteroids (short-term, high-dose pulse therapy) should be given. Acitretin\\n(25–75mg/d) in combination with topical fluorinated corticosteroids have also been\\nshown to be effective. Alternatively, sulfasalazine has been used successfully. Arthritis\\nis also treated with oral gold. There is one report on the successful use of infliximab\\nin a patient with Reiter’s syndrome without negative effects on the viral load (Gaylis\\n2003).\\nScabies: Scabies can be found worldwide; prevalence varies from <1% to 30% depend-\\ning on the socio-economic circumstances. Scabies is characterized by extreme pru-\\nritus, especially at night. In general, the clinical presentation does not differ from\\nthat seen in HIV-negative persons. In the interdigital areas (volar sides) of the joints\\nof the hands, breasts, axillae, periumbilical region, or penile shaft, fine red burrows\\n(S-shaped or straight lines) may be found. There may be a small papule or vesicle at\\none end. Excoriations and/or secondary infections make the identification of burrows\\ndifficult. Generalized eczematous eruption may be seen. Typically in the groin or on\\nthe genitals red-brown pruritic nodules can be found. These scabies granulomas can\\npersist for months even after successful therapy.\\nIn the case of severe cellular immunodeficiency crusted scabies or Norwegian scabies\\ncan occur. Besides HIV+ patients, persons with general physical or mental debilita-\\ntion are affected. Over weeks or months, eczematous lesions covered with asbestos-\\nlike crusts extend over large areas and the plaques can be mistaken for psoriasis.\\nCrusted scabies is extremely infectious and carries many more mites than regular\\nscabies – up to 10,000 mites/g scales. The history of unremitting and intractable\\nitching is suggestive of scabies. The diagnosis is made by the clinical picture and\\nproven by the demonstration of the mites, their ova, or fecal droppings in the scales.\\nOn histology, the female mite can be seen in the stratum corneum.\\nA single application of permethrin 5% cream is performed (whole body application\\nfrom chin to toes, usually excluding the face; leave on skin for 8 hours, then shower\\noff). In cases of crusted scabies, the scales have to be removed over several days\\n (salicylic ointments) and therapy has to be repeated over 3–4 days. Alternative ther-\\napies are hexachlorocyclohexane (lindane), benzoylbenzoate, pyrethrum extracts or\\nallethrin/piperonyl butoxide, all applied for 3 days. It is important to treat all contact\\npersons at the same time. \\nLinens and bed clothes have to be changed daily. Depending on the clinical pres-\\nentation another treatment one week later is sometimes recommended (as a safety).\\nIn cases of severe immunodeficiency the scalp has to be treated too. If more than\\n50% of the skin is affected or several recurrences have occurred a combination of\\nkeratolytic/topical therapy against scabies and systemic treatment with ivermectin\\nis recommended. Hygienic measures to prevent contact infections are extremely crit-\\nical. A single therapy with 2 tablets (6 mg each; or 200 µg/kg) is generally sufficient.\\nIvermectin is not licensed for this indication. There are no reports on complications\\nafter this therapy in HIV-infected patients (Dourmishev 1998).\\n620 Interdisciplinary Medicine'),\n",

The lipophilic yeast Malassezia furfur (formerly Pityrosporum ovale) is believed\\nto be of pathogenetic relevance. Here the specific subtype appears to be more impor-\\ntant than the density of colonization. In HIV infection 20–80% of untreated people\\nare affected depending on the immune status (Chatzikokkinou 2008). Seborrheic\\ndermatitis appearing de novo or exacerbation could indicate conversion of HIV infec-\\ntion from a latent state to a symptomatic state (Ippolito 2000).\\nAreas rich in sebaceous glands, such as the scalp, forehead, eyebrows, nasolabial\\nfolds, over the sternum, between the shoulder blades, external ear canal and retroau-\\nricular area, develop yellowish oily scales and crusts on mildly erythematous to very\\nred plaques. The lesions may be pruritic.\\nThe clinical picture is typical in most cases. Differentiation from psoriasis may be\\ndifficult both clinically and histologically. Initially other forms of eczema such as\\nallergic contact dermatitis and atopic dermatitis may have similar presentations.\\nDue to the pathogenic role of Pityrosporum ovale, topical antifungals such as keto-\\nconazole cream, other topical imidazoles or triazoles, or alternatively selena disul-\\nfide, metronidazole, and low-dose dithranol or lithium succinate- and zinc-sulfate-\\ncreams are used. For the scalp antimycotic shampoos, zinc pyrithione or\\ntar-containing products are used. In severe cases systemic antimycotics are given like\\nketoconazole (200 mg QD), itraconazole (100 mg QD) or terbinafine (250 mg QD).\\nSyphilis: see chapter on HIV and Sexually Transmitted Diseases.\\nTinea (dermatophytosis, ringworm infections): Infections of the skin, hair or nails\\nwith dermatophytes (in Western Europe predominantly Trichophyton, Microsporum\\nand Epidermophyton species). Tinea has a high prevalence in the general population.\\nThere is no significant difference between HIV-negative and HIV+ adults. The preva-\\nlence depends upon climate, profession, clothing, and participation in team sports.\\nTypical clinical findings are superficial, scaling, round or oval erythematous plaques\\nthat expand centrifugally with an inflammatory edge and central clearance. Deep\\ninfections with tissue destruction and abscess formation are rare in Europe and North\\nAmerica but common in tropical regions. According to Torssander (1988)\\n onychomycosis due to dermatophytes is frequent in ART-naïve patients and diffi-\\ncult to treat. Nails are discolored (white, yellow, green, black), thickened and show\\ngrowth disturbances (onychodystrophy). Subungual hyperkeratosis and  onycholysis\\nare common.\\nPsoriasis, yeast infections and trauma can imitate onychomycosis so it is necessary\\nto identify the causative organisms on KOH and fungal culture. Direct microscopic\\nexamination with the addition of 10-15% KOH solution shows translucent, septated\\nhyphae (mycelium) and arthrospores. Calcofluor or Blankphor microscope slides can\\nbe used for diagnostic immunofluorescence microscopy. Culture on Sabouraud’s or\\nKimmig’s medium identifies different fungi by their growth characteristics.\\nTreatment of superficial fungal infections of the skin is best achieved with topical\\nbroad spectrum antifungals such as ciclopirox or -azoles applied twice daily. In severe\\ninflammatory disease it is helpful to start with combination therapy including topical\\ncorticosteroids for 3 or 4 days to achieve quick relief. Deep infections and infections\\ninvolving terminal hairs (tinea capitis, tinea barbae) require systemic treatment with\\ngriseofulvin 500–1000 mg/day, terbinafine 250 mg/day, fluconazole 50 mg/day, or\\nitraconazole 100–400 mg/day (Elewski 2001, Millikan 2001). There are different\\n regimens to treat onychomycosis. Itraconazole and terbinafine are typically used for\\ntwo months for fingernails and three months for toenails. Griseofulvin may be used\\nfor up to 9 months or longer, until the infection clears (Aly 1996, Myskowski 1997,\\nTorssander 1988).

In the pre-ART era, we diagnosed dry skin in one in three HIV+ patients\\n(Table 1). The patients complain of dry, itchy skin, which is exacerbated by any stim-\\nulus. Overall, these skin problems are very much like atopic dermatitis (Rudikoff\\n2002) and can culminate in acquired ichthyosis.

Patients should be advised to take\\nmaximum one shower every (other) day. 1 to 2 oil baths per week should be rec-\\nommended.

HIV-1-associated Neurocognitive Disorder \\n(HAND) and Myelopathy\\nCHRISTIAN EGGERS, THORSTEN ROSENKRANZ\\nHIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND)\\nTerminology, etiology and epidemiology \\nIn 2007 an international panel (Antinori 2007) devised three categories of HAND in\\norder of descending severity: HIV-1-associated dementia (HAD), HIV-1-associated\\nmild neurocognitive disorder (MND), and HIV-associated asymptomatic neurocog-\\nnitive impairment (ANI) (“Frascati criteria”). This replaces the older terms HIV ence -\\nphalopathy, AIDS dementia complex, and HIV-associated cognitive motor complex. \\nTable 1: The classification system of HAND (“Frascati criteria”) (Antinori 2007)\\nHIV-associated asymptomatic Neuropsychological testing with impairment (≥1 standard \\nneurocognitive impairment deviation) in cognitive function in ≥2 functional domains*.\\n(ANI) The impairment does not interfere with everyday functioning.\\nHIV-1-associated mild Cognitive results as in ANI.\\nneurocognitive disorder At least mild interference in daily functioning (at least one of the\\n(MND) following): \\na) Self-report of reduced mental acuity, inefficiency in work, \\nhomemaking, or social functioning.\\nb) Observation by knowledgeable others that the individual has \\nundergone at least mild decline in mental acuity with resultant \\ninefficiency in work, homemaking, or social functioning.\\nHIV-1-associated dementia Marked acquired impairment in cognitive functioning.\\n(HAD) Cognitive results as in ANI, but typically multiple domains \\naffected, and impairment ≥2 standard deviations. Marked \\ninterference with day-to-day functioning (work, home life, social \\nactivities).\\nFor all categories, delirium must be excluded, and there must be no alternative plausible cause.\\n*considering age- and education-adjusted norms. Cognitive domains are: verbal/language;\\nattention/working memory; abstraction/executive; memory (learning; recall); speed of information\\nprocessing; sensory-perceptual, motor skills\\nThe primary cause of HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) is an\\n infection of the CNS caused by HIV. If untreated, there is a high level of replication\\nof HIV in the macrophages and microglial cells of the brain. Neural cells have not\\nconsistently been shown to be infected. However, different immunopathological\\nmechanisms lead to structural damage of these cells with subsequent neurocogni-\\ntive impairment (NCI). With respect to viral replication and viral quasispecies, the\\nCNS is partially independent from the hematolymphatic compartment (Eggers 2003,\\nEggers 2013), and this may lead to “viral excape” with direct clinical consequences\\n(Canestri 2010, Peluso 2012). A recent autopsy study on patients with advanced HIV\\ninfection found aspects of Alzheimer’s pathology and unspecific histological changes\\nas equally associated with HAND as the classical HIV pathology (Everall 2009). \\nAs the life expectancy of HIV+ individuals in the developed world now comes close\\nto that of the general population (May 2014), the prevalence of HAND has risen to\\n627'),\n",

With ART, the prevalence of severe cases has\\ndecreased while that of the minor variants has increased (Heaton 2011). Among indi-\\nviduals in the WHO/CDC clinical stage A, however, a slight to moderate impairment\\nis more frequent than in the pre-HAART-era. Longitudinal cohort observations have\\nshown that many patients with asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI),\\neven with suppressed plasma viral load, will eventually develop symptomatic NCI\\n(Cole 2007, Grant 2014). Patients who were diagnosed and treated early after infec-\\ntion had a low prevalence of NCI (Crum-Cianflone 2013). A study of treated  subjects\\nwith initially low but increasing CD4 T cell counts showed some improvement of\\ncognitive function, but this remained worse than that of an HIV-negative control\\ngroup (Mc Cutchan 2007). Frequent subjective complaints of reduced cognitive\\n performance with and without objective correlates on formal neuropsychological\\ntesting have been found in many patients with longstanding suppression of plasma\\nviral load (Simioni 2010). HAND is associated with a shortened survival (Sevigny\\n2007) and with poor medication adherence (Albert 1999).\\nIt is generally accepted that HAND, in untreated patients, at least in its more severe\\nstages, is a treatable condition. However, the extent and sustainability of the effects\\nof ART on cerebral function are still unclear. Progressive, clinically relevant, and, at\\ntimes, fluctuating neurocognitive impairment may occur in patients on suppressive\\nART (Brew 2004, Antinori 2007, Canestri 2010, Peluso 2012). \\nHIV-1-associated dementia (HAD) as the most severe HAND manifestation is now\\nrare on ART (Price 2008). However, more subtle but, with regard to working\\n performance, significant dysfunction may be seen in everyday clinical practice, and\\nit now occurs at earlier stages of HIV-induced immunosuppression (Sacktor 2001,\\nDore 2003). \\nIn the pre-HAART era, the time course of the CSF and plasma viral load and the\\ncurrent CD4 T cell count were predictors of HAND, but this has now changed.\\nLongitudinal studies in ART-treated subjects without dementia show low nadir CD4\\nT cell counts, previous AIDS, longer duration of HIV infection, low educational status,\\nolder age, plasma levels of TNF-alpha and MCP-1, illicit drug use, and comorbidity\\nin general to be predictors for the development of HAND (Robertson 2007, Sevigny\\n2007, Tozzi 2007, Bhaskaran 2008, Heaton 2010, Mind Exchange Group 2013). The\\noccurrence and/or persistence of HAND, despite effective suppression of plasma viral\\nreplication, might be associated with chronic immune activation within the CNS,\\nas suggested by persistently elevated levels of neopterin and anti-MOG antibodies\\nin the CSF (Eden 2007, Lackner 2010), and by microglial activation on brain positron\\nemission tomography (PET) (Garvey 2013). This observation might suggest some\\n“uncoupling” of mechanisms within the CNS from those in the hematolymphatic\\ncompartments. Contrary to earlier estimates, HCV coinfection seems not to confer\\nNCI (Clifford 2015).\\nCases of severe HAD with high levels of CSF viral load were observed in patients with\\nwell-suppressed plasma viral load (“viral escape”) on ART (Venkataramana 2006,\\nCanestri 2010, Peluso 2012). In an autopsied patient, numerous CD8-positive lym-\\nphocytes were found in the perivascular spaces and the parenchyma, partly in close\\nspatial association with neurons. This condition may be interpreted as an immune\\nreconstitution phenomenon directed against HIV itself (Venkataramana 2006).\\nClinical manifestation\\nHAND is considered to be a subcortical dementia. With the introduction of ART,\\nsigns of cortical involvement and memory impairment have become more promi-\\nnent, while motor signs have become less important (Heaton 2011). \\n628 Interdisciplinary Medicine'),\n",

Formal neuropsychological cognitive testing,\\nthe gold standard, should be done. This should encompass the domains verbal/\\nlanguage, attention/working memory, abstraction/executive function, learning/\\nrecall, speed of information processing, and motor skills (Mind Exchange Group\\n2013). Where a trained neuropsychologist is not available, the HIV dementia scale\\nas an easy-to-use bedside instrument may be used, but its sensitivity and specificity\\nare limited (Morgan 2008). \\nLaboratory tests are mainly employed to exclude differential diagnoses. MRI is\\n preferred to CT. The MRI may show patchy, diffuse, and relatively symmetrical hyper-\\nintense lesions in the white matter. These changes indicate leukoencephalopathy.\\nIn addition, atrophy with enlargement of the ventricles and the extraventricular CSF\\nspaces may be seen. However, none of these findings are specific for HAND, and the\\ndisease may evolve with a normal MRI. Unlike in PML, the white matter lesions do\\nnot affect the cortical U-fibers, i.e., they do not reach the cortical ribbon. Edema and\\nspace occupying lesions are not compatible with HAND and should raise suspicion\\nof other conditions. \\nCSF analysis mostly shows a normal white cell count, and with severe immunosup-\\npression this may even be decreased. In patients with an at least partially effective\\nART, CSF pleocytosis may be seen, suggesting an immunological response to HIV in\\nthe context of immune reconstitution. Total protein and albumin concentrations\\nmay be slightly elevated (blood-brain barrier disruption). Oligoclonal bands and\\nincreased IgG index indicate autochthonous immunoglobulin production within\\nthe CNS. However, these findings are non-specific, and they are frequently present\\neven in the asymptomatic stages of HIV infection. \\n630 Interdisciplinary Medicine'),\n",

However, this association is no longer true for individu-\\nals on ART (Mc Arthur 2004, Heaton 2011). The electroencephalogram (EEG) shows\\nno or only mild signs of generalized slowing. Moderate or severe slowing or focal\\narrhythmic delta activity are atypical for HAND. \\nWith a large part of the HIV+ population growing older, other types of dementia\\nsuch as Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, etc. need to be\\ndifferentiated by appropriate diagnostic steps. \\nScreening and Treatment\\nScreening for HAND is recommended in all HIV+ patients, regardless of treatment\\nstatus (Mind Exchange Group 2013). This should ideally be carried out before initi-\\nation of ART in order to generate baseline data. Screening should be done every 6\\nto 24 months, according to the risk profile of the patient. The HIV dementia scale,\\nthe MoCA test, and the NEU screen have been validated in HIV+ patients as screen-\\ning instruments (Morgan 2008, Munoz-Moreno 2013, Brouillette 2015). When results\\nare abnormal, further neurological and neuropsychological work-up should be done.\\nAccording to the pathogenesis of HAND, treatment should aim at suppressing viral\\nreplication in the CNS. Although the CNS is a separate compartment of viral repli-\\ncation, the initiation of ART in a treatment-naïve patient leads to a rapid decline of\\nthe CSF viral load in most patients (Eggers 1999+2003). In this situation of no prior\\nART the clinical improvement may be dramatic in cases of severe HAND (HAD) while\\nthe effect size is lower in less severe cases (MNC). HAD patients may regain working\\nability and independence from caregivers, and this takes some 3 to 9 months to\\nevolve (Cysique 2009). During the first months of treatment and despite clinical\\nimprovement, the radiological signs of leukoencephalopathy may become more\\nprominent, but eventually will regress. \\nThe indication for ART in treatment-naïve patients with symptomatic HAND (MNC\\nor HAD) is undisputed. In the situation of a patient with established ART it is obvi-\\nously important to make sure that plasma virus replication is suppressed. Beyond\\nthis step, it is largely unknown what antiretroviral compounds and in what combi-\\nnation these are best suited for the treatment of HAND. The extent of penetration\\ninto the CSF and the brain parenchyma is generally assumed to be essential, and\\nthis view is supported by early findings of little suppression of the CSF viral load by\\nregimens containing only PIs (Gutmann 2010). A CNS penetration efficacy score\\n(CPE) was devised by Letendre et al. (2011). It is composed of the relative values of\\nthe CNS penetration of the substances and comprises four categories, where lower\\nscores indicate lower CNS penetration (Table 6). Most studies showed a higher CPE\\nscore to be associated with lower CSF viral loads e.g. (Letendre 2008, Cysique 2011,\\nCusini 2013). However, whether a higher CPE score is associated with better clini-\\ncal, i.e., neurocognitive performance is less clear. The majority of studies, though,\\ndid show a modest but significant positive effect (Cysique 2011, Vassallo 2014). Two\\nsmall randomized trials that prospectively examined ART regimens with higher vs.\\nlower CPE scores were published. One showed slightly better cognitive results with\\nhigher CPE scores (Winston 2010), while in the other such an effect was significant\\nonly in the subgroup with suppressed plasma viremia (Ellis 2014). These diverging\\nresults are likely due to the differing methodology and the uncertainty of how to\\nmeasure and define CNS penetration as well as to other factors with impact on HAND.\\nThe notion of the importance of suppressing the CNS viral replication is, however,\\nsupported by case series of patients with long-standing suppression of the plasma\\nviremia but detectable viral replication in the CSF (viral escape). These subjects had\\nHIV-1-associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) and Myelopathy 631'),\n",

A further argument for achieving high enough\\nlevels of antiviral compounds in the CNS is its role as a viral reservoir and the finding\\nof resistant viral strains in the CSF (Smit 2004, Canestri 2010). It is therefore\\n recommended that antiviral regimens contain CNS-penetrating compounds, and this\\nis even more important with symptomatic CNS involvement of HIV (Mind Exchange\\nGroup 2013). \\nAs mounting evidence suggests a major pathogenic role of monocytes, a monocyte\\nefficacy score has been published that is closely associated with cognitive function-\\ning (Shikuma 2012).\\nSeveral non-antiviral substances have been tried as an adjunctive treatment for HAND\\n(minocycline, memantine, selegiline, lithium, valproate, lexipafant, CPI-1189,\\npeptide T, nimodipine, psychostimulants, rivastigmine). Although all proved to be\\nsafe, none exhibited meaningful clinical effects (Sacktor 2011, Simioni 2013).\\nNon-pharmacological interventions include the treatment of concomitant condi-\\ntions such as liver disease, major depressive disorders, the management of cardio-\\nvascular and metabolic risk factors, as well as the improvement of drug adherence\\n(Mind Exchange Group 2013). \\nNeurotoxicity of antiretroviral substances may be considered in patients develop-\\ning or maintaining neurocognitive and psychiatric dysfunction. Neuropsychiatric\\nside effects are best documented for efavirenz, but these are mostly transient. Some\\nauthors reported on cognitive dysfunction with suppressive ART that resolved with\\nwithdrawal of ART, but these results have been questioned by others (Munoz-Moreno\\n2010, Grund 2013). In view of its systemic effects, however, treatment interruptions\\nare not recommended. If neurotoxicity is suspected, the ART regimen might be\\naltered (Mind Exchange Group 2013). \\nWhile there used to be a discussion about the optimal time point to start antiviral\\ntreatment in relation to cognitive impairment, in some guidelines ART is now rec-\\nommended in all HIV+ subjects irrespective of the stage of the disease. With the\\nresults of the START study (see ART chapter), almost all patients will begin ART. The\\ncurrent EACS guidelines (November 2014) recommend to screen for and, when\\nappropriate, to perform the diagnostic steps for HAND. In case of established diag-\\nnosis, CNS-active drugs should be considered. The US DHHS guidelines (April 2015)\\nrecommend to initiate ART at any stage of HIV infection, but does not recommend\\nspecific antiretroviral drugs in HAND-affected patients. \\nSome evidence suggests an early initiation of ART for the prevention of HAND (Ellis\\n2011), but the value of CNS-penetrating compounds is unclear. \\nDepression is frequent in HIV infection (Pence 2012). Depressed people tend to over-\\nreport cognitive symptoms (Thames 2011), while on formal testing, a skilled\\n neuropsychologist/neurologist will find normal or near-normal cognition. Patients\\ncomplaining of cognitive symptoms should therefore be examined for depression as\\nthe depression may actually be the cause of the cognitive complaints (so called \\n“pseudodementia”). \\n632 Interdisciplinary Medicine'),\n",

The histopathological hallmarks\\nare prominent vacuoles in the cervical and thoracic parts of the spinal cord and lipid-\\nladen macrophages, hence the term “vacuolar myelopathy” (Petito 1985). These\\nchanges are reminiscent of severe combined degeneration (i.e., vitamin B12 defi-\\nciency). \\nAs HIV viral products have only inconsistently been shown to be part of the lesions,\\nthe role of HIV is uncertain. A disturbance of cobalamin-dependent transmethyla-\\ntion has been discussed. Like HAND, HIVM occurs mainly with advanced immuno-\\nsuppression. Not all patients with autopsy findings of vacuolar myelopathy had\\nshown clinically apparent myelopathy during life (dal Pan 1994).\\nA patient may be suspected of having HIVM if he has a spastic-atactic gait, hyper-\\nreflexia with positive Babinski sign, disturbance of sphincter control, erectile dys-\\nfunction, and slight signs of sensory dysfunction in a glove and stocking distribu-\\ntion. The diagnosis of an independent HIVM should only be made when the\\nconcomitant cognitive impairment is significantly less prominent than the myelopa-\\nthy. Increased latencies of somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEP) and motor-evoked\\npotentials on transcranial magnetic stimulation (MEP) are compatible with the diag-\\nnosis. CSF, microbiological and spinal imaging studies are inconspicuous or non-spe-\\ncific, and they have their importance in the exclusion of other diagnoses, as listed\\nin Table 7. Spinal imaging should include MRI of the cervical cord and possibly the\\nthoracic cord. \\nTreatment\\nEarly observations of significant improvement with AZT monotherapy (Oksen -\\nhendler 1990) were later confirmed with ART.

Neuromuscular Diseases\\nTHORSTEN ROSENKRANZ, CHRISTIAN EGGERS\\nPolyneuropathy and polyradiculopathy\\nPeripheral neuropathy is the most common neurologic complication of HIV infection.\\nEven in the era of modern antiretroviral therapy neuropathic signs and symptoms\\nare found in about 30% of patients (Evans 2011). Neuropathies can be classified as\\nprimarily HIV-associated or as secondary diseases caused by neurotoxic agents or\\nopportunistic infections. Distal symmetrical sensory polyneuropathies (DSSP) related\\nto HIV infection have been on the decline since the introduction of ART, but there\\nhas been an increase in the prevalence of medication-related toxic neuropathies\\n(Gonzalez-Duarte 2008). Even though the incidence rate of the other types of neu-\\nropathies is low, they require a precise and rapid diagnosis because many of them\\ndo benefit from specific therapies.\\nClinical features\\nAcute, inflammatory, demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP),\\nGuillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) \\nAIDP usually occurs at seroconversion or during the asymptomatic stages of HIV\\ninfection. It seems to be rarely associated with immune reconstitution. Typical clin-\\nical signs are areflexia, symmetrically ascending weakness and relative sparing of\\nsensory nerve fibers. Involvement of cranial nerves and cervical and thoracic spinal\\nnerves leads to respiratory insufficiency, dysarthria and dysphagia. Parasympathetic\\nand sympathetic nerve involvement may cause life threatening cardiac arrhythmias\\nand severe arterial hypo- or hypertension. CSF typically shows a raised concentra-\\ntion of protein caused by the dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier. In contrast to\\nHIV-negative patients with AIDP, a moderate pleocytosis of up to 50 leucocytes/µl\\nCSF is found in most HIV-infected patients. The progressive stage is followed by a\\nfew days or weeks of stable disease until recovery begins. If secondary axonal damage\\nhas occurred, recovery can last up to two years. A persistent disability of varying\\ndegrees develops in about 30%.\\nChronic, inflammatory, demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) \\nWhereas AIDP is a monophasic, self-limiting disease, the course of CIDP is chronic\\nprogressive or relapsing-remitting. Weakness and sensory disturbances commonly\\ndevelop over several months. In some cases relapses, incomplete remissions and\\nperiods of stable disease alternate with each other. In CIDP, as in AIDP, the CSF is\\nabnormal with an elevated protein level. A moderate pleocytosis is often found\\ninstead of the classical acellularity. CIDP is a rare complication of seroconversion or\\nthe early stages of HIV infection.\\nVasculitic neuropathy\\nNecrotizing vasculitis with involvement of the peripheral nerves is a rare cause of\\nneuropathy in HIV infection. Most patients develop a mononeuritis multiplex char-\\nacterized by acute relapsing dysfunction of individual peripheral nerves. Prognosis\\nof the disease is determined by involvement of other organs such as heart, kidneys\\nor muscles in the vasculitic process. An immune complex attack associated with hep-\\natitis C virus infection or cryoglobulins appears to play an essential role in the patho-\\nlogical mechanism.\\n638'),\n",

The clinical course is predom-\\ninated by slowly progressive sensory symptoms such as numbness, dys- and\\n paresthesia in the feet and lower legs (Table 2). Approximately 30-50% of patients\\ncomplain of burning, lacerating or stabbing pain. It mainly involves toes and soles\\nof the feet and sometimes makes walking difficult. The most important clinical\\n findings are depressed or absent ankle reflexes, an elevated vibration threshold at\\ntoes and ankles and a decreased sensitivity to pain and temperature in a stocking\\ndistribution, whereas proprioception is usually normal.

Subclinical disturbance of peripheral nerve function con-\\nfirmed by pathological findings in electrodiagnostic studies elevates the risk of devel-\\noping NRTI-related neuropathy. \\nPIs seem to have a very low additional neurotoxicity. In combination with d4T, ddI\\nor ddC they seem to be an additional risk factor for neuropathy (Ellis 2008, Evans\\n2001). The instruction leaflets of many PIs list peripheral neuropathy as a possible\\nside effect, because neuropathic symptoms were slightly more often reported in the\\nPI arms of clinical trials. In combination with ddI, d4T and ddC, PIs seem to be a\\nrisk factor for neuropathy on their own (Ellis 2008, Evans 2011). But there are no\\nreports of cases of neuropathy that developed while on PI treatment that resolved\\nafter withdrawal. In clinical experience, the risk of PI-induced neuropathy is very\\nlow. A few cases of neuropathy due to darunavir have been reported, but it remains\\nunclear if the PI is really the cause of neuropathy in these cases (Lorber 2013). \\nTable 3: Neurotoxic drugs frequently used in HIV medicine\\nNRTI  ddI, d4T (ddC, no longer manufactured) \\nAntibiotic  dapsone, metronidazole, isoniazid\\nCytotoxic  vincristine, etoposide\\nAcute neuromuscular weakness syndrome\\nIn the course of an NRTI-induced lactic acidosis a life threatening tetraparesis resem-\\nbling AIDP may occur. In most cases axonal peripheral nerve damage is found, but\\nin a few patients demyelination is also detected. In addition, muscle biopsy reveals\\nmyositis or mitochondrial myopathy in some cases (Simpson 2004).\\nPolyneuropathy and polyradiculopathy due to other diseases\\nIn patients with advanced HIV disease, mononeuritis multiplex may be caused by\\nCMV infection or lymphoma. Acute or subacute polyradiculopathies of the cauda\\nequina with rapidly progressive flaccid paraparesis of the legs, bowel dysfunction\\nand sensory disturbances occur in the course of opportunistic infections (CMV , \\nM. tuberculosis) or meningeal non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Other important causes of\\npolyneuropathy are alcohol abuse, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition in patients with\\nlong-lasting gastrointestinal diseases, neoplastic diseases or cachexia.\\nDiagnosis\\nA diagnosis of neuropathy can usually be made based on medical history and clin-\\nical examination. Electrodiagnostic studies may be performed for confirmation and\\nfor differentiation from other diseases such as myelopathy. Cerebrospinal fluid analy-\\nsis may be necessary if there is a suspicion of infection with, for example, CMV or\\nsyphilis. Sural nerve and muscle biopsy may be necessary only in atypical cases – for\\ninstance, painful DSSP with a high CD4 cell count and low viral load and without\\nneurotoxic medication or other risk factors. Table 4 gives some recommendations\\nfor clinical practice.\\nOccasionally, patients report complaints of burning feet, aches, pain and tingling\\nbut clinical examination and nerve conduction studies are unremarkable. In these\\ncases symptoms might be due to an isolated small fiber neuropathy exclusively affect-\\ning the small unmyelinated vegetative nerve fibers. Diagnosis requires a punch skin\\nbiopsy with histological assessment of intraepidermal nerve fiber density or pain-\\nrelated evoked potential conduction testing (Obermann 2007).\\nNeuromuscular Diseases 641'),\n",

Intravenous immunoglobulins and plasmapheresis have proven\\neffective in the therapy of AIDP. Corticosteroids are also effective in CIPD. In clini-\\ncal trials on the treatment of CIDP, no difference in the efficacy of immunoglobu-\\nlins, plasmapheresis or corticosteroids has been shown. However, an individual\\npatient may only respond to one of the three options. In patients who only respond\\nto higher dosages of corticosteroids, other immunosuppressive agents such as aza-\\nthioprine, low dose weekly methotrexate or cyclosporine may replace long-term\\nsteroid therapy. We have seen CIDP patients who were in partial remission after tem-\\nporary steroid therapy and who have remained stable for years with ART alone.\\nIn medication-related neuropathy the offending agent needs to be withdrawn. The\\nintake of 2 g L-acetylcarnitine significantly reduced pain in HIV patients with\\n neurotoxic neuropathy (Youle 2007).\\nA causative treatment for DSSP does not exist. ART might improve the function of\\nsensory nerves in a few cases, and therefore starting ART or optimizing a current ART\\nshould be considered in newly diagnosed DSSP. In most cases the neuropathic symp-\\ntoms still persist.\\nSymptomatic treatment is directed at irritative symptoms such as pain and paresthesia.\\nIt is not effective against deficits of nerve function including sensory loss or weakness.\\nThe agents listed in Table 6 are recommended because they have proven useful in\\ndaily practice and because they interfere only slightly and in a predictable way with\\nART. A controlled study showed that lamotrigine was effective in reducing the symp-\\ntoms of neurotoxic neuropathy (Simpson 2003). The drug is well tolerated if one\\nadheres to the slow dose escalation regimen and stops treatment or reduces the dose\\nwhen a skin reaction occurs. In a small study, gabapentin was shown to be effective\\nin reducing DSSP-induced pain (Hahn 2004). The advantages of this agent are good\\ntolerability and lack of interference with ART. Pregabalin, an anticonvulsant drug\\nsimilar to gabapentin, effectively relieves pain in studies of patients with painful dia-\\nbetic peripheral neuropathy (Rosenstock 2004). Like gabapentin, it does not inter-\\nfere with ART and is well tolerated. It is commonly used in DSSP, although a recent\\ntrial in HIV patients did not show efficacy (Simpson 2010).\\nThe tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline and nortriptyline both have significant\\nanticholinergic side effects. The dose necessary for reducing neuropathic pain is in\\nthe same range as for treating depression and many patients can not tolerate these\\ndosages. However, lower dosages have proved ineffective in DSSP. Nortriptyline has\\nno sedative side effects. We use this agent with good success rates, although clinical\\ntrials for its use in HIV-associated neuropathy are lacking. The antidepressant dulox-\\netine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, has been approved for the treat-\\nment of painful diabetic neuropathy. In our experience it is also useful in reducing\\npain in DSSP and toxic neuropathy in HIV+ patients. The anticonvulsant carba-\\nmazepine is widely used for the treatment of neuropathic pain. However, it induces\\nsome enzymes of the CYP450 system and interferes significantly with ART. Thus, its\\nuse in HIV medicine is very limited. \\nA high-concentration capsaicin patch has recently been shown to be effective in the\\ntreatment of pain in DSSP patients (Mou 2013). The patch is now available in Europe\\nand in US, where it is OTC. The responsiveness varies considerably from patient to\\npatient, but the somewhat laborious application is worth a try.\\nIn two trials smoked cannabis has proven effective against neuropathic pain in DSSP\\n(Abrams 2007, Ellis 2009). However, the effect was rather short-lived. Oral cannabi-\\nnoids have not been tested yet in painful HIV neuropathy.\\nNeuromuscular Diseases 643'),\n",

AZT-induced myopathy occurs very infrequently with the dosages used\\ntoday (500–600 mg/day). Other agents such as ddI, cotrimoxazole, pentamidine, sul-\\nfadiazine, lipid-lowering drugs and the integrase inhibitor raltegravir (Zembower\\n2008) may rarely cause acute rhabdomyolysis with tetraparesis and marked eleva-\\ntion of serum CK levels. Notably, PIs raise the serum concentration of statins, increas-\\ning the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis (Hare 2002). Raltegravir causes rarely\\na chronic limb girdle myopathy with paresis and myalgia (Lee 2012). An elevated\\nserum CK activity is frequently observed during treatment with TDF, especially in\\npatients with HBV/HCV coinfection. This is due to a type 2 macroenzyme creatine\\nkinase (macro CK) and must not lead to suspicion of ischemic heart or of muscular\\ndisease. The accumulation of this liver-derived isoenzyme seems to be the result of\\nan insufficient macro CK-2 clearance capacity mediated by TDF (Schmid 2005).\\nClinical features\\nMyopathy in HIV infection usually presents with exercise-induced myalgia of prox-\\nimal muscles followed by slowly progressive, symmetrical weakness and atrophy of\\nproximal muscles. Limb girdle muscles are most commonly involved, but distal\\nmuscles and muscles of the trunk, neck, face or throat may also be affected.\\nDiagnosis\\nMyalgia, fatigue and elevated serum CK levels are frequently found in HIV infection.\\nSome of the antiretroviral substances, mainly AZT, nevirapine and maraviroc, may\\ncause myalgia. But these unspecific symptoms and signs on their own do not warrant\\nthe diagnosis of myopathy. The diagnosis of probable myopathy requires weakness,\\nmuscle atrophy or myopathic features demonstrated by electromyography. A muscle\\nbiopsy confirms the diagnosis and may give some additional clues to the classifica-\\ntion and pathogenesis of the muscle disease.\\nTreatment\\nModerate myalgia may respond to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\\nPrednisone (100 mg daily for 3–4 weeks, subsequent tapering) or intravenous\\nimmunoglobulin (0.4 g/kg for 5 days) have been shown to be effective in treatment\\nof polymyositis (Johnson 2003, Viard 1992). The treatment of AZT myopathy is ces-\\nsation of the drug. Myalgia usually resolves within 1–2 weeks. If symptoms persist\\nbeyond 4-6 weeks, prednisone as described above may be effective.\\nReferences\\nAbrams DI, Jay CA, Shade SB, Vizoso H, et al.

Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)\\nTHORE LORENZEN\\nTransmission routes and risks\\nTransmission of HIV may occur if someone comes into contact and incorporates the\\nblood, semen or vaginal fluids of an HIV+ source person. Exposure of intact skin to\\nHIV-contaminated material (e.g., blood) is not sufficient. Besides vertical transmis-\\nsion, HIV transfer is possible if HIV-containing material enters the body by:\\n\\x81 needlestick injury or incision by surgical instruments\\n\\x81 exposure of damaged skin or mucosal membranes\\n\\x81 unprotected sexual intercourse with an infected person \\n\\x81 IDU needle or equipment sharing\\n\\x81 transfusion of HIV-contaminated blood or blood products\\nOverall, HIV is a low contagious pathogen. The transmission rate ranges between\\n1:100 and 1:1000. The transmission rate for hepatitis C and B are approximately 10\\nand 100 times higher, respectively. Factors associated with transmission risk include\\nthe amount of source-incorporated virus transmitted and the length of exposure\\ntime. Contact with body fluids of a patient with a high viral load probably holds a\\ngreater risk than a similar contact with body fluids of a patient on ART with a viral\\nload below level of detection. Additionally, rapid removal of infectious material, e.g.,\\nfrom damaged skin or mucosal membrane by washing or disinfection, presumably\\ndecreases the risk of transmission. For percutaneous contact with HIV-containing\\nblood, a transmission rate of 0.3% on average is assumed. Using retrospective data,\\nrates have been calculated more precisely (Table 1).\\nTable 1: Calculations to assess estimated individual transmission risk after HIV exposure* \\nType of Exposure Relative Risk\\nDeep needle-stick injury or cut 16:1\\nFresh blood on the penetrating instrument 5:1\\nPenetrating needle previously placed in blood vessel 5:1\\nSource person with high viral load 6:1\\nExposition of mucosal membrane 1:10\\nExposition of inflammatory damaged skin 1:10\\n* Source: German-Austrian recommendations for PEP against HIV infection 2013\\nFor information about assumed transmission risk of other types of exposure, please\\nrefer to first chapter of this book (Introduction). Simian models show that in mucosal\\nmembranes, HIV primarily infects the local immunocompetent cells such as\\nLangerhans cells. These cells and/or their sibling cells migrate to regional lymph\\nnodes; detection of HIV in the blood occurs days later. The process of local infection\\nand migration of the cells to the lymph nodes takes approximately 24–48 hours (Spira\\n1996, Otten 2000). Theoretically, immediate treatment may avert a systemic infection.\\nEffectiveness and limitations of PEP\\nEarly reports on the use of AZT after occupational needle-stick injuries date from\\n1989. An analysis of retrospective case-control studies shows that even prophylaxis\\nwith a single antiretroviral agent after exposure reduces the probability of an infec-\\ntion by approximately 80% (Tokars 1993). In theory, the combination of multiple\\ndrugs seems to be even more potent. \\n651'),\n",

The rate of primary resistances\\nin naïve patients varies by region and country, but over the years it has stabilized at\\napproximately 10 to 15% for at least one agent or drug class.

It should also be emphasized that no antiretroviral agent\\nis approved for use in this setting (although Truvada\\n® is approved for PrEP in the\\nUS, it is not licensed for PEP!). Besides the legal responsibility of the prescribing\\nphysician, these facts are also important with regard to the coverage of cost, espe-\\ncially after sexual exposure. For example, in Germany, although some regional and\\nnational plans will cover a limited program of PEP, the medication cannot be pre-\\nscribed at the expense of health insurance companies; however, PEP for occupational\\nexposure is usually covered by statutory accident insurance.\\nTable 2 gives an overview of situations in which PEP is recommended. Of note, risk\\nassessment has changed in the last years: following the Swiss statement (EKAF 2008,\\nsee chapter on ART and Prevention), the newest British PEP guidelines have modified\\ntheir recommendations: in case of an HIV+ source person without detectable viral\\nload, PEP should only be provided after receptive anal intercourse. In cases of\\ndetectable viral load, PEP is recommended in direct homo- or heterosexual inter-\\ncourse. In case of unknown serostatus of the source person, the use of PEP is very\\nrestrained (Benn 2011). Similar opinions are found in current French and German\\nguidelines. The overview of recommendations for PEP usage should serve as an ori-\\nentation, although alterations can occur in individual cases.\\nPotential risks of PEP\\nAdverse effects of the antiretroviral drugs have to be taken into account, most fre-\\nquently gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Changes\\nin hematology, liver enzymes, and/or creatinine are less frequent. Additionally, there\\nhave been reports of elevated triglycerides and cholesterol levels, and insulin resist-\\nance even with short-term use of PIs (Parkin 2000).\\nIt is unknown whether the temporary use of ARVs may lead to long-term side effects.\\nHowever, all this is secondary since the main emphasis is to prevent a chronic and\\npotentially life-threatening disease. For pregnant women, particular caution is\\nrequired since data concerning teratogenicity are lacking.\\nInitial interventions\\nDifferent procedures are recommended following exposure to HIV , depending on the\\ntype of exposure. Following needlestick or cut injuries with HIV-contaminated instru-\\nments, fluid should be expressed by squeezing the tissue surrounding the wound\\nand striking out proximal blood vessels towards the wound. Very intense massage\\nor contusions should be avoided. The wound should be flushed with an alcoholic\\nvirucidal antiseptic for a minimum of 10 minutes. For skin that has been in contact\\nwith blood or body fluids removal of the infectious material and subsequent exten-\\nsive disinfection with a skin antiseptic appears sufficient. After contamination of an\\neye, immediate flushing with water or antiseptic solutions is recommended. The oral\\ncavity should be rinsed several times (10-15 seconds each) with an aqueous solution\\nor alcohol after contact with potentially infectious material.\\nPersons who, through sexual exposure, have had contact with anal or genital mucosae\\nfrom infectious material, should wash the penis with soap and water; genital mucosae\\nshould be flushed with water after urination in order to wash contaminated mate-\\nrial from the urethra. Intense deep washing of the vagina or rectal enemas are not\\nrecommended due to an elevated risk of injuries. Following these initial interven-\\ntions, an expert in HIV treatment should be consulted for the decision on whether\\npharmaceutical PEP needs to be initiated.\\nPost-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) 653'),\n",

The process of inform-\\ning the patient about the risks of PEP needs to be documented carefully and the\\npatient should sign an informed consent.\\nInitiation of PEP\\nTiming is the most crucial factor as the best chance to prevent transmission is within\\nthe first 24 hours of exposure, preferably within 2 hours after exposure. A deferred\\ninitiation increases the risk of systemic spread of the virus. Initiating PEP after more\\nthan 72 hours following exposure does not seem reasonable. In this short time frame,\\nif consultation with a physician experienced in HIV treatment is not possible, it\\nmight be advantageous to just initiate PEP. Interrupting a regimen that is not indi-\\ncated is always an option.\\nFor a long time most recommendations have favored a regimen with a combination\\nof antiretroviral agents given for 4 weeks, preferably consisting of two NRTIs and\\none PI. In current updates the integrase inhibitor raltegravir is most preferred due\\nto its excellent tolerability. NNRTIs, especially nevirapine, should not be used for\\nPEP because of the risk of severe adverse effects such as severe hepatotoxicity (CDC\\n2001).

Drug-Drug Interactions\\nJAN THODEN\\nWith an increasing number of antiretroviral drugs there is an growing risk of adverse\\ndrug-drug interactions. These might interfere with therapeutic success. Moreover,\\nantiretroviral drugs are used by an aging patient population with a variety of \\nco-morbidities requiring additional medications. \\nBy inducing or inhibiting enzyme production, the elimination of a drug and hence\\nits plasma levels are influenced. Especially metabolization by cytochrome-P450 plays\\na crucial role. As many drugs, PIs and NNRTIs are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4\\nin liver and the gastrointestinal tract. Another pathway is the glucuronidation by\\nglucuronosyltransferases, though this usually does not cause clinically relevant inter-\\nactions. Moreover, there are major interindividual differences in enzyme activity and\\ndrug metabolization rates. Other factors that need to be considered include genetic\\npolymorphisms, ethnicity, age, sex, and co-morbidities.\\nThe tables provide a brief overview of drug combinations deemed safe (+) as well as\\nthose that should be avoided (\\nL). However, for many combinations the interactions\\nare uncertain, unknown or can only be assumed based on theoretical calculations\\n(\\nK). In these cases, use might still be safe and should be controlled by TDM.\\nThe first part is focused on ART/ART interactions, the second part on those between\\nART and concomitant medications. \\nAmong the INSTIs, elvitegravir is listed as the fixdose tablet Stribild\\n® (STB). Cobicistat\\nstand-alone (Tybost ®) which is approved in combinations with atazanavir and\\ndarunavir, is not listed, as well as irrelevant drugs such as d4T, ddI indinavir, nelfi-\\nnavir. All PIs are assumed to be given boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat. T-20 is\\nonly mentioned in the first part as there are no known relevant interactions.\\nThis chapter is intended as a tool to support rapid decision making in the daily prac-\\ntice, but should not replace a literature search. On rare occasions, drug combina-\\ntions with known adverse effects might be unavoidable due to a lack of alternatives.\\nIn these cases, close monitoring (including TDM) is necessary. \\nIndividual questions regarding interactions can be answered by experts (e.g. www.ifi-\\ninteraktions-hotline.de). Several APPs serve this purpose, too (e.g. HIV iChart of the\\nUniversity of Liverpool).\\nAbbreviations:\\n+ Combination of these drugs possible \\nK Potential interactions or unknown, combination of these drugs is often \\npossible, therapeutic drug monitoring suggested\\nL Combination of these drugs should be avoided or is contraindicated\\n↑ up to 50% increased drug levels, ↑↑ up to 100%, ↑↑↑ >100%\\n↓ up to 50% decreased drug levels, ↓↓ up to 100%, ↓↓↓ >100%\\nBID Twice daily (TID = Three times daily.

Several antiar-\\nrhythmics, antihistamines, ergotamines and sedatives (midazolam) should be\\navoided. Tipranavir reduces the serum level of other PIs, so a double PI regime is not\\napplicable.
